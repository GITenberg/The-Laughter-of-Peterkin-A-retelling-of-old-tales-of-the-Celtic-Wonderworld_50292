<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the rising of the moon, Peterkin awoke,
and laughed. He was in his little white
bed near the open window, so that when a
moonbeam wavered from amid the branches
of the great poplar, falling suddenly upon his
tangled curls and yellowing them with a ripple
of pale gold, it was as though a living thing
stole in out of the June night.</p>

<p>He had not awaked at first. The moonbeam
seemed caught in a tangle: then it
glanced along a crescent tress on the pillow:
sprang back like a startled bird: flickered
hither and thither above the little sleeping
face: and at last played idly on the closed
eyelids with their long dark eyelashes. It was
then that Peterkin awoke.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes he sat up, and
so the moonbeam fell into the two white cups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of his tiny hands. He held it, but like a
yellow eel it wriggled away, and danced mockingly
upon the counterpane.</p>

<p>With a sleepy smile he turned and looked
out of the window. How dark it was out
there! That white moth which wavered to
and fro made the twilight like a shadowy wall.
Then upon this wall Peterkin saw a great
fantastic shape. It grew and grew, and spread
out huge arms and innumerable little hands:
and in its shadow-face it had seven shining
eyes. Peterkin stared, awe-struck. Then there
was a dance of moonshine, a cascade of trickling,
rippling yellow, and he saw that the shape
in the night was the familiar poplar, and that
its arms were the big boughs and branches
where the spotted mavis and the black merle
sang each morning, and that the innumerable
little hands were the ever-tremulous, ever-dancing,
round little leaves, and that the seven
glittering eyes were only seven stars that had
caught among the topmost twigs.</p>

<p class="secthead">II</p>

<p>Peterkin was very sleepy, but before his
head sank back to the pillow he saw something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
which caused him to hold his breath, and made
his eyes grow so round and large that they
were like the little pools one sees on the hill-side.</p>

<p>Every here and there he saw tiny yellow
and green lives slipping and sliding along and
in and out of the branches of the poplar.
Sometimes they were all pale yellow, like gold;
sometimes of a shimmering green; sometimes
so dusky that only by their shining eyes were
they visible. At first he could not clearly distinguish
these unfamiliar denizens of the great
poplar. The vast green pyramid seemed innumerously
alive. Then gradually he saw that
each delicate shape was like a human being:
little men and women, but smaller than the
smallest children, smaller even than dolls.
They were all laughing and chasing each other
to and fro. Some slid swiftly down an outspread
branch, and then dropped on to a green
leafy billow or plunged into an inscrutable
maze: others swung by the little crook at the
end of each leaf, and laughed as they were
blown this way and that by puffs of air: and
a few daring ones climbed to the topmost
sprays of the topmost boughs and held up tiny
white hands like daisies. These wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
clasp the moonshine. As well might a fish
try to catch the moon-dazzle on the water!
No wonder Peterkin laughed.</p>

<p>Ever and again a delicate sweet singing came
from the moonshine-folk. Peterkin listened,
but could hear no words he knew. Perhaps
there were no words at all, or mayhap he
himself knew too few. But the singing was
strangely familiar. Sometimes when mother
sang, surely he had heard it: as far back,
farther back, than memory could take him, he
had heard some echo of it. Cradle-sweet it
was, that dim snatch of a fugitive strain. And,
too, had he not heard something of it in the
wind, when that went whispering through the
grass and in and out of the wild-rose thicket,
or when it lifted and waved a great wing and
fanned the trees into vast swaying flames of
green? Yes, even in the fire he had heard
it. When the orange and red flames flickered
among the coals, or caught the sap in the
pine-logs and grew into yellow and blue with
hearts of purple, he had heard a faint far-off
music.</p>

<p>Peterkin gave a little gasp when a sudden
wave of shadow, trailed across the poplar by
a long slow-travelling cloud, swept from bough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to bough. It was as though all the singing,
laughing, dancing folk had been drowned.</p>

<p>He stared through the darkness, but there
was nothing to be seen. He shivered. It
was lonely out there. Again he heard a
sound as of a remote singing. As before, he
could not hear what the words were. But,
once more, it was not all unfamiliar. It was
sadder than anything that dimly he remembered,
save the long mournful crooning of a
Gaelic cradle-song, sadder than any flame-whisper
in a waning fire, or than any cadence
of the wind in the grass, or among the thickets
of wild rose.</p>

<p class="secthead">III</p>

<p>Next night Peterkin lay awake a long time,
hoping to see the moonshine-folk again. He
had spoken of them, but was told that there
were no little people in the poplar. At first this
was the more strange to him, for had he not
seen them? Then, after he had scrupulously
examined the branches from beneath as well
as at a distance, he comforted himself with
the thought that, while there might be no little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
people actually living in the poplar, they came
into the tree on the flood of the moonshine.</p>

<p>But that night there was no moon-flood. A
south wind had arisen at sundown, and had
shepherded from beyond the hills a medley of
strayed clouds: these, intricately interwoven,
now spread from horizon to horizon, obliterating
the stars and obscuring even the radiance
of the new-risen moon.</p>

<p>If there were no moonlight, and therefore
no little yellow and green lives with bright
shining eyes, there was a strange exquisite
whispering that grew into music sweeter than
any which Peterkin had ever heard.</p>

<p>He rose and crept stealthily from his bed
to the door. It was ajar, and he looked, half-fearfully,
half-wonderingly, into the open passage.
How long and dark it was, and haunted
by unfamiliar shadows: but, clasping the skirts
of his nightgown close to him, he ran swiftly
to the balustrade at the far end.</p>

<p>There the stair lamp shed a comfortable
glow. Peterkin looked warily down the stairs,
into the hall, along the closed or opened rooms.
There was no one stirring. The front door too
was open, for the night was warm, or perhaps
some one had strayed without.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The child stood awhile, hesitating. Then
he slipped down the stairway like a swift moonbeam.
For the first time he realized he was
only a little child, when he passed the great
antlered stag’s-head in the hall, and the high
stand hung with coats and hats, the raiment
of giants as they seemed, and mysteriously
life-like.</p>

<p>But once in the open air he lost all fear.
True, a great mass of rhododendrons ran close
to the avenue to the right, and through this
the path meandered to the gardens behind
the house: but there was nothing unfamiliar
about their gloom, for Peterkin loved their
green shadowy depths at noon, and their fragrant
dusk when the long shadows on the lawn
slept longer and bluer, till they sank invisibly
into the grass.</p>

<p>Old Donal McDonal the gardener, on his
way through the shrubberies, rubbed his eyes:
for he thought he saw a sprite. He could have
sworn, he said to Mairgred Cameron the cook,
after he entered the house, that he had seen
a small white ghost flitting from bush to bush.
Both shook their heads, and wondered if the
White Lady were come again, that apparition
which legend averred was to be seen by mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
eyes once in every generation, and always
before some tragic event or death itself.</p>

<p>But as for Peterkin he had no thought of
such things. He was now in the garden, eager
in his quest of the little people who hide
among leaves and grass, and love the dusk
and the moonlit dark.</p>

<p>He had no fear as he ran to and fro along
the grassy ways. Why should he be afraid
of the dark? There was nothing there to
frighten him, or any child.</p>

<p>For a time he ran to and fro, or crept warily
among the lilac bushes. His little white figure
drifted hither and thither like a moth. Once
he was still, when he stood, shimmering white,
among the lilies of the valley, which clustered
among their green sheaths at the far end of
the garden. Here, a few days ago, he had
buried a dead bird he had found under a net.
It was a thrush, the gardener had told him,
puzzled at the slow tears which welled from
the eyes of the little lad. And now Peterkin
wondered if the bird were awake.</p>

<p>He had gone to Ian Mor, who was staying
with his father and mother, and told him about
the buried bird: and Ian had comforted him
with this tale:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>“Long ago there was a great king. He had
the wisdom of wisdom, as the saying is. One
day the plague came to his kingdom, and he
lost the three lives which were dearest to him
in all the world. These were his mother, his
wife, and his little son.</p>

<p>“This king was a poet and dreamer, as well
as a great warrior and prince, and he had ever
been wont to have communion with the powers
and sweet influences which are behind the innumerable
veils of the world. Through these
he had come to know the mystery of the Spirit
of Life.</p>

<p>“With this Eternal Spirit he held communion
in his deep sorrow. It was then that he
learned how what is beautiful cannot pass, for
beauty is like life that is mortal, but whose
essence does not perish. In fragrance, in
colour, in sweet sound, somehow and somewhere,
that which is beautiful is transmuted
when suddenly changed or slain.</p>

<p>“So he prayed to the Spirit of Life that his
dear ones might not pass from him utterly.</p>

<p>“On the morrow, when he rose and went into
his favourite place in the royal gardens, a
secret hollow in a glade of ilex and pine, he
saw a fountain of exceeding beauty. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
spray rose dazzling white against the sombre
green of the old trees, and seemed to be alive
with a myriad rainbow-spirits, who ceaselessly
flashed their wings as they darted hither and
thither. The king was looking upon this,
entranced by its sunny loveliness, when he
noticed a white dove flying round the high
sunlit fount, and at the hither margin of the
water a cream-white dappled fawn, which
stooped its graceful neck and drank.</p>

<p>“The king marvelled; for not only had there
never been any fountain in that place, but he
knew that no wild fawn could wander there
from the distant forests, and no dove had he
ever seen so snowy white and with wings
radiant as though stained by the rainbow-hues
of the flying spray.</p>

<p>“Suddenly it was as though a mist fell from
his eyes. He saw and understood. His old
mother, his wife, his little son, had not passed
away, although they were dead. His mother
had been fair and beautiful even in her
white-hair years; and of the beauty of his wife,
whom he loved so passing well, the poets had
sung from one end of the land to another;
while his little son had been held to be so
perfect that there was none like him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>“And now the king saw that the beauty of
his mother had passed into a living fount of
waters, whose spray cooled the air and made a
sound of aerial music and a laughing radiance
everywhere; and that the beauty of the woman
whom he had loved so passing well was transmuted
into the wild fawn which drank at the
water’s edge; and that the beauty of his little
son was now the white dove which beat its
wings in the rainbow spray.</p>

<p>“The king rejoiced therein with a great joy.
Many of his people thought him mad, but he
smiled at that saying, and with grave eyes
prayed that that madness would come to all
true and noble souls in his kingdom.</p>

<p>“For a year and a day this joy was his.
Then the fountain ceased to rise, and the dove
to beat its pinions in the spray, and the wild
fawn to drink at the water’s edge. The
rumour went from mouth to mouth that this
was because the plague had come again. The
king was heavy with sorrow, for he had taken
his deepest happiness in the beauty of these
three lovely things, as, of yore, in the beauty
of his aged mother, and in the beauty of the
woman whom he loved, and in the beauty of
his little son. So once again he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
how he had been helped. With shame at his
heart he upbraided himself because he had
lived too much to the things of the moment
and so had lost touch with those which
were of the enduring life. That night he
spent in unspoken prayer and prolonged
meditation; and at dawn on the morrow he
went slowly and sadly forth, hoping against
hope that his life might be gladdened again.</p>

<p>“The sun rose as he crossed the glade of ilex
and pine. There was no fountain, as he well
knew; but where the fountain had been he
saw a garth of wild hyacinths, of a blue so
wonderful that no Maytide sky was ever more
delicately wrought of azure and purple. And
above this were two little brown birds, which
sang with so sweet voice and bewildered rapture
that his heart melted within him.</p>

<p>“Then he knew that in these new joys he
had found again the beauty he had lost.</p>

<p>“When, in the change of the days, the
hyacinths spilt their blue wave into the rising
green of the fern, and the birds ceased singing
their lovely aerial songs, the king no longer
grieved, for now he knew that what was
beautiful would not perish but drift from change
to change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>“And so it was. For when, weary of his
pain, he went forth one night to the lovely
glade of ilex and pine, he saw the ground
white with the little blooms we call Stars of
Bethlehem, and among these a glow-worm lay
and glowed like a lamp in a white wilderness,
and from an ancient ilex came the voice of a
nightingale.</p>

<p>“Thus the king was comforted.</p>

<p>“And so you too, Peterkin,” added Ian
Mor, “need not sorrow too much for your
little dead bird. It will live again mayhap in
the fragrance of a lily or in the beauty of a
rose. It will rise again, Peterkin.”</p>

<p>This tale had sunk deeply into the child’s
mind, and perhaps all the more so because
the words, and the meaning behind the words,
were sometimes beyond him. But he understood
well the drift of what Ian Mor had
told him.</p>

<p>He was prepared for any miracle. If his
little bird should rise through the brown earth
and ascend singing towards the stars; or if he
should hear a song and see no bird; or if a
fount should well from where its body lay;
or if a rare bloom should spring from the earth;
or if a fragrance, new and sweet, should reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
him&mdash;if one of these things should happen, or
anything akin, it would be no surprise to
him.</p>

<p>But while he was still wondering, he heard
voices.</p>

<p>“Peterkin! Peterkin!”</p>

<p>He did not answer, but laughing low to
himself, crept in among the lilies-of-the-valley,
and lay there, himself like a white bloom. The
voices came near, nearer, and passed by.
Peterkin’s heart smote him, for he heard the
pain in the calling voices; but it was so cool
and quiet there among the lilies, and it was
so sweet to be out of sight of every one and
lost, that he could not break the spell.</p>

<p>What if he were to be found by the elfin-folk
and led into fairyland? He thrilled both with
fear and eager delight at the thought. Surely
even now he heard the delicate music of the
lily-bells?</p>

<p>Peterkin did not know that he had a neighbour.
Suddenly, he heard a faint rustle. Ah,
it was one of the Shee&mdash;one of the little
people! Mayhap it was the green Harper,
of whom Ian Mor had told him, or one of the
seven star-crowned queens, or the haughty
Midir, with a peacock’s feather in his moon-gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hair, or Fand, who walked in fairy dew,
or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then Peterkin saw who his neighbour
was. From under a stone, beset by lily-sheaths,
a small toad crawled. Its strange
bright eyes were fixed upon the staring child,
whom, however, it did not seem to heed after
it had once examined this strange white creature
who lay among the lilies.</p>

<p>Suddenly Peterkin began to laugh. The
toad sat still, solemnly regarding him. Peterkin
laughed the more. Once the toad gave
a short jump, though this was not from fear, or
even from lack of interest in his unfamiliar
neighbour, but because a gnat had come temptingly
almost within reach of his long, thin,
serpentine tongue.</p>

<p>“Tell me, toad,” Peterkin said at last, “why
are you so funny?”</p>

<p>Whether it was because the toad was not
given to gaiety, or whether his disappointment
about the gnat had soured him, he did not
respond save by an unwinking stare. After a
while it shot out its tongue, as though it were
speculating as to Peterkin’s flavour as a
pleasant morsel, or perhaps only to find if he
were within reach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much for Peterkin, who rolled
back among the lilies, crushing the little white
bells into a floating fragrance. But, alas, that
betraying laughter!</p>

<p>Peterkin was still in its throes when he heard
a voice falling upon him as though out of the
skies.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are, you little rascal! How
you frightened us all, and what a hunt we have
had!”</p>

<p>Almost before he recognised the voice of
Ian Mor, Peterkin was seized and lifted high
into the air.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, Ian,” the child whispered.
“I came out to see the fairies. And then I
ran on here to see if the little dead bird had
come out of the earth again.”</p>

<p>“And have you seen a fairy, Peterkin?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I saw a toad.”</p>

<p>“What did the toad do?”</p>

<p>“It looked at me till I laughed. Then it
put out its tongue, and I laughed and laughed
and laughed.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking that toad must have been a
fairy in disguise, Peterkin. But now come:
I am going to carry you back to your bed.”</p>

<p>And whether it was because of Peterkin’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
escape into the garden, or what vaguely came
to him there, or what Ian Mor told him as he
carried him homeward in his arms, he did hear
the horns of elf-land that night, and did see the
gathering of the Shee in the moonshine. But
it was in a drowsy hollow in the dim wood
of sleep, wherein the birds were white soft-pinioned
dreams, and the moon waxed and
waned like the lily that sinks and rises in dark
pools.</p>

<p class="secthead">IV</p>

<p>In those first fragments of Peterkin’s experiences,
all his life was foreshadowed. Wonder,
delight, longing, laughter&mdash;the four winds of
childhood&mdash;these blew for him through his first
few years, through childhood and boyhood and
youth. He is a man now; but though the
laughter is rarer and the longing deeper and
more constant, there still blow through the
dark glens and wide sunlit moors of his mind
the four winds of Laughter, Longing, Wonder,
and Delight.</p>

<p>As year after year went by, his mind became
a storehouse of all that was most beautiful and
marvellous in the Celtic wonder-world. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
no wonder this, since he had for story-teller
Ian Mor, and Eilidh whom Ian loved; and
knew every shepherd on the hillsides of
Strachurmore, and every fisherman on the
shores of Loch Fyne. The old ballads, the
old romances, the strange fragments of the
Ossianic tales, the lore of fairydom, fantastic
folk-lore, craft of the woodlands, all of the
outer and inner life grew into and became
interwrought with the fibre of his most intimate
being.</p>

<p>I am not here telling the story of Peterkin
himself. He stands, indeed, for many children
rather than for one, for many lives and not an
individual merely.</p>

<p>In a sense, therefore, Peterkin is not merely
a little child, a boy, a youth, who went through
his years gladly laughing, mysteriously wondering,
wrought to pain and joy, to suffering and
delight, by all he saw and heard and inwardly
learned; but a type of the Wonder-Child,
and so a brother to all children, to poets, and
dreamers.</p>

<p>Of the many tales of old times which Peterkin
loved, none did he dwell upon with so
much delight as those three which are familiar
throughout Ireland and Gaelic Scotland as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
“The Three Sorrows of Story-Telling.” In
“The Children of Lir,” in “Deirdre and
the Sons of Usna,” in “The Children of
Turenn,” he found pre-eminently the haunting
charm and sad exquisite beauty which are the
colour and fragrance of the Celtic genius.
And though in his manhood he turned with
deeper emotion to tales such as “Dermid and
Grainne,” or “The Amadan Mor,” it was of
these early favourites that he loved to think,
that he loved to re-read, to hear again, to re-tell.</p>

<p>That is why, therefore, I have chosen to
make this book essentially a re-telling of the
beautiful old tales of “The Three Sorrows,”
so familiar once to our Gaelic ancestors, and
still, in however crude a form, the most popular
of all the tales of the Gael. They are sad, it
is true, because all the old beautiful tales are
sad; but it is a sadness which is a fragrance
about an exquisite bloom, and that bloom
wrought of joy and keen delight. They were
not sad, they who lived the old, joyous, heroic
life; in some poignant vicissitude, some sudden
slaying, some passing of a bright flame
into a melancholy wane, we see a sad gleam
about the end of their days, and, seeing thus
the fortuitous coming and going of life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
death, read into the old chronicles a melancholy
which often is not there.</p>

<p>Of course, a tale such as “The Fate of the
Children of Lir”&mdash;probably the story known
above all others among the children of Western
Scotland and Ireland&mdash;is sad with another
sadness, that of prolonged and unmerited
suffering. But to the Gaelic mind, at least, this
is redeemed by the sense of heroic endurance,
of the deep unselfish devotion of a lovely
womanly type such as is represented by Fionula,
and perhaps, above all, by the music and
beauty which were the sweet doom of Fionula
and her brothers.</p>

<p>But to me not one of them is sad, save with
beauty. For through all I hear the sound of
Peterkin’s laughter. Sometimes it was aroused
by an episode; sometimes it leapt like a hound
along the trail of vagrant thoughts; sometimes
it came and went as an eddying wind, none
knowing whence or whither.</p>

<p>This laughter of Peterkin has become for me
one of the sweet wonderful voices of nature&mdash;the
four winds of Childhood: Wonder, Delight,
Longing, and Laughter. Ah, children,
children, to one and all I wish the golden
fortune of Peterkin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p class="secthead">V</p>

<p>When Peterkin was still a child he was
familiar with tales of the old world which now-a-days
we keep from children, because they are
not old enough to understand. That, I fear,
is more because we ourselves do not understand,
or are out of sympathy. Is a child more
likely to be hurt, or to be nobly attuned to the
chant-royal of life, by acquaintance with stories
of vivid and beautiful human love such as
that of Nathos and Darthool, or Dermid and
Grainne? Surely, what is beautiful is not a
thing to be feared; and though, alas! so many
of us do now indeed dread beauty and feel
toward it a strange baffled aversion, there are
others who know it to be the profoundest and
most exquisite mystery in life.</p>

<p>To Peterkin at any rate there was never
anything but what was stirring and heroic and
full of charm and beauty in these old tales: and
through all his days their atmosphere was in
his mind, so that he made life fairer for himself
and others.</p>

<p>Few stories delighted him more than the
wild folk-lore tales which he heard from the
shepherds and fishermen, or than those which
he was told on Iona. It was to that island he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
was taken when he was still a child, at a time
when the shadow of death darkened his young
life. But there, staying with Ian Mor and with
Eilidh, his wife, he lived the happiest months of
his early years, and came closer to the beauty
of the past and to the beauty of the present
than ever before or after.</p>

<p>It was on Iona that he first heard the
“Three Sorrows of Story-Telling,” though
that of Nathos and Darthool&mdash;or of “The
Sons of Usna,” as it is generally called&mdash;was
rather overheard by him as Ian related it to
Eilidh, than told to him direct.</p>

<p>Throughout the first months of his stay in
Iona, Peterkin was told something daily by
Ian Mor, so that, child as he was, he became
familiar with strange names and peoples of the
past, as well as with all the wonders of the
living world. True, there was thus in his
mind a jumble of the past and the present, and
Columba was more real to him than McCailin
Mor himself, and Finn and Cuchulain, Ossian
and Oscar and Dermid as vivid and actual as
any fisherman of Iona.</p>

<p>When he was old enough to follow aright,
Ian Mor told him, anew and in his own way,
the three famous tales which follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

White Swans</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> story that I will tell you now is one
of the most famous among all the peoples
of the Gael. It is called sometimes “The
Tale of the Four White Swans,” sometimes
“The Fate of the Children of Lir,” sometimes
simply “Fionula,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> because of the beauty and
tenderness of Lir’s daughter.</p>

<p>The tale is of the old far-off days. It was
old when Ossian was a youth, and Fionn heard
it as a child from the lips of grey-beards.
Often I have spoken to you, Peterkin, of the
Danann folk, the Tuatha-De-Danann who lived
in the lands of our race before the foreign
peoples came and drove the ancient dwellers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Ireland and Scotland to the hills and remote
places. When men allude to them now in this
late day, they speak of the Dedannans (as they
are often called) as the Hidden Folk, the Quiet
People, the Hill Folk, and even as the Fairies.
It is natural, therefore, that years are as dust in
the chronicles of this lost race. They live for
hundreds of years where we live for ten; and
so it is that the foam of time is white against
the brief wave of our life, when against the
mighty and long reach of theirs it is but flying
spray.</p>

<p>You have heard Eilidh singing the song of
the Four White Swans. It is a music that
hundreds of tired ears have heard. It is so
sweet, Peterkin, that old men grow young, and
old women are girls again, and weary hearts
ache no more, and dreams and hopes become
real, and peace puts out her white healing
hand.</p>

<p>“Have you heard that singing, Ian?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boykin, often. And you, too,
shall often hear it. It is in lonely places, in
lonely hours, that you shall hear it. It is a
beautiful strange sound, and so old and so
wonderful that in it you will hear the beating of
the heart of the world thousands of years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
But first I will tell you the story of the Four
Swans, and then we can speak again of the
strange singing I have heard at times, and that
you often shall hear.”</p>

<p>The Dedannans were the most wonderful
and happy people in the world till they became
discontented with what the unknown and beautiful
gods had given them. Then they split
into sections, and some sought one vain thing
and some another, and in the end all found
weariness. Their wise men knew that as long
as they were at one no enemy could prevail
against them; but it has never been the way of
the unquiet to believe in the old wisdom, and
so feuds arose, and the Fairy Host itself&mdash;as
the great array of the warriors of the Tuatha-De-Danann
was called&mdash;ceased to be invincible,
because the banners blew to the four winds.</p>

<p>Not all their ancestral sojournings in the dim
lands of the East, nor in the ages of their
migration to the country of fjords which has its
whole length in the sea, nor in Alba, that is
now Scotland, nor Eiré, that is now Ireland, not
all they had learned in their remote past helped
them against the undoing of their own folly.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Dedannans never
fought against men till the Milesians, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
warriors of Miled out of some land in the
south&mdash;the land, mayhap, we know as Spain&mdash;came
against them upon the banks of a river
then as now called the Blackwater, in the heart
of Meath.</p>

<p>But before the Dedannans themselves ever
saw it, the Green Isle was held by the Firbolgs,
a terrible, heroic race, but allied to the
dark powers. Some say they became demons,
after they were defeated in many battles by the
Tuatha-De-Danann, and at last wholly conquered.
But so old is this ancient tired world,
that long before the Dedannans and the Firbolg
people fought for sovereignty, the Firbolg had
striven with and overcome an earlier race&mdash;the
Nemedians&mdash;which had come to Ireland under
a mysterious king, Nemed. None knows who
Nemed was, though he may have been a god,
seeing that he overcame that most ancient
people who were the first to set foot in the Isle
of Destiny, under Partholan, a son of him who
was called the Most High God.</p>

<p>Whether it be true or not that the overlordship
of the world was meant for man,
certain it is that man has thought so. Therefore
are all stories of his cosmic strife coloured
by this destiny. Terrible and mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
were the Firbolgs, fierce and terrible and beautiful
were the Dedannans, but now there is no
rumour of either, save in the wail of the wind,
or in the stirring of swift, stealthy feet in the
moonshine.</p>

<p>But now, Peterkin, I will tell you about
the children of Lir, who was one of the great
princes of the Dedannans.</p>

<p>The first great battle between the Milesians
and the Dedannans had been fought, and
the ancient people, for all their secret powers
of wonders and enchantment, had been defeated.
Throughout all Erin&mdash;for Ireland at
that time was called either Eiré (Erin), or
Fola, or Banba, after three great queens&mdash;there
was a rumour of lamentation. It was the
beginning of the end, though few save the
wisest Druids foresaw it.</p>

<p>But the people knew that their dissensions
were the cause of their sorrow. They
clamoured for one king to be overlord, so that
the whole Dedannan race might be united.</p>

<p>There were five great princes who claimed
to be king by right. Of these two were
greater than the others&mdash;Bove Derg, son of
Dagda, one of the divine race (and some say a
mighty god), and Lir of Shee Finnaha. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the end Bove Derg was elected Ardree, or
High King. Even Midir the Haughty acquiesced
in this judgment of the people, but Lir
was wroth and held aloof. All the princes and
warriors were fierce with Lir because he had
left the assembly in anger, paying heed to no
one, and scornfully ignoring the majesty of the
king. A hundred swords of proven heroes
leapt before Bove Derg, for all were eager to
follow Lir and destroy him and his, because of
the insult to the king and to the voice and
freewill of the people. But Bove Derg was a
wise and generous prince, and forbore. This
was well. For in time a great sorrow came
upon Lir. When the rumour of this sorrow
reached Bove Derg, he saw how he might win
over Lir.</p>

<p>“In my house,” he said, “are my three
foster-children, the daughters of Aileel of Ara.
Each is beautiful, all are wise and sweet and
noble. Let messengers go to Lir, and tell him
that my friendship is his if he will have it.
Surely now he will submit to the will of the
people. And he can have to wife whomsoever
of the three daughters of Aileel he may choose,
if so be that she will gladly and freely go with
him.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Lir was glad at this message. He called
his warriors together, and in fifty chariots he
and they set forth. They rested not till they
came to the palace of Bove Derg, by the Great
Lake, nigh to the place now called Killaloe.
Great were the rejoicings, and again at the
alliance which after many days was made
between the king and Lir.</p>

<p>When Lir saw the three daughters of
Aileel, he could not say who was the most
beautiful.</p>

<p>“Each is alike beautiful, O king,” he said;
“and I cannot tell which is best. But surely
the eldest must be the noblest of the three, and
so I will choose her, if so be that she gladly
and freely come with me as my wife.”</p>

<p>And so it was. When Lir returned to his
own place, he took with him as his wife the
beautiful Aev, who was the eldest of the
daughters of Aileel of Ara, and was foster-child
of Bove Derg the king. From that day, too,
a deep and true friendship lived between Bove
Derg and Lir.</p>

<p>In the course of time Aev bore him twin
children, a son and a daughter. The daughter
was named Fionula, because of her lovely
whiteness, and the son was named Aed, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
that his eyes, and the mind behind his eyes,
were bright and wonderful as a flame of fire.</p>

<p>And at the end of the second year Aev
again bore twin children. Both were sons, and
they were named Fiachra and Conn. But in
giving them life she lost her own.</p>

<p>Lir was in bitter distress because of her
death, and for the reason that his four little
children were now motherless. He was comforted
by Bove Derg, who not only gave
him friendship and kingly aid and counsel, but
said that he should not be left alone to mourn,
and that his little ones should not go motherless.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Aeifa, the second of the
daughters of Aileel of Ara and foster-child of
Bove Derg the king, came to Shee Finnaha
and espoused Lir.</p>

<p>For some years all went well. Aeifa
nursed the children, and tended them. They
were so fair and beautiful that the poets sang
of them far and wide. Even Bove Derg loved
them as though they were his own. As for
Lir, so great was his love, that he could not
bear to be long apart from them. His sleeping-room
was separated from them only by a deerskin,
and this often he pulled aside at dawn, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
that he might see his dear ones, and perchance
go to them to talk lightly and happily, or to
caress them with loving laughter and joy.</p>

<p>Lir was never sad save when the four
children went south to the Great Lake to
stay awhile with Bove Derg, who in his turn
was filled with melancholy when the time
came for them to go home again. Nor was
Lir ever so proud as when, at the Feast of
Age, whenever that festival came to be held
at Shee Finnaha, the king and the nobles and
the warriors delighted in the beauty and marvellous
sweet charm of Fionula and Aed and
Fiachra and Conn. Thus it was that the saying
grew: “Fair as the four children of
Lir.”</p>

<p>But there was a deep shadow behind all this
joy. This shadow came out of the heart of
Aeifa. In love there is sometimes a poisonous
mist. It is what we call Jealousy. At first
Aeifa truly loved her step-children. But as
the years lapsed, and when Fionula was passing
from girlhood into maidenhood, the wife of
Lir was filled with anger against the four children.
She was bitter at heart because their
father loved them with so great a tenderness,
and that even the king himself cared for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
above all else, and because all the Dedannans
had joy of them.</p>

<p>The time came when this dull smouldering
fire, which she might have overcome had she
loved nobly and not ignobly, burst into flame.
This flame withered her heart, and rose thence
till it obscured her mind.</p>

<p>She had something of the old druidical
wisdom, but she feared the counter-spells of
others wiser than herself. Nevertheless she
set herself to learn one or other of the ancient
incantations against which even the gods are
powerless to avert evil from men and women.</p>

<p>While she was brooding thus&mdash;and for
weeks and even months she lay in the house
of Lir as one stricken with some terrible ill&mdash;her
rage grew till she could no longer endure
the sight of her husband or of her step-children.</p>

<p>One day she arose and ordered the horses
to be yoked to her chariot, and bade a small
chosen company to be ready to go with her
and the four children to the Great Lake: for,
she said, she wished to see Bove Derg, her
foster-father, and to take the children to gladden
his heart. Lir was sad, and sadder still
when he saw the tears in Fionula’s eyes. In
vain he asked her why this drifting dew was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
there instead of the sun-bright laughing glancings
he joyed so much to see. She would not
answer: for all she could have said was that
in a dream she had fore-knowledge of the evil
desire of Aeifa to kill her and her brothers.
Perhaps, she thought, it was but a dream.
She loved honour, too, and would not put her
father against his wife because of a visionary
thing that came to her in the night.</p>

<p>It was when they were in a deep gorge of the
hills that Aeifa was overcome by her hatred.
Turning to her attendants, she offered them
wealth and whatsoever they desired if only
they would slay the four children of Lir then
and there, inasmuch as these had come between
her and her husband, and had therein and in
all else made her life a burden to her.</p>

<p>The attendants listened with horror. Not
one there would lift a hand against Lir’s children.
What was wealth, or any fruit of desire,
compared with so foul a treachery, so terrible a
crime! The oldest among them even warned
Lir’s wife that the very thought of such evil
would surely work a dreadful punishment
against her.</p>

<p>At this, Aeifa laughed wildly. Then,
seizing a sword, she strove to wield it herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
against the defenceless children. The three
boys stood, wondering. In the blue eyes of
Fionula there was something the wife of Lir
dreaded more than the wrath of husband or
king. Dashing the sword to the ground, she
cried to the chariot-driver to make haste onward.</p>

<p>No word was spoken among them till they
reached the hither end of the Lake of Darvra.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
There Aeifa called a halt, and the horses were
unyoked for rest. It was a fair and warm day,
so when she bade the children undress and go
into the water, they did so gladly.</p>

<p>While their white sunlit bodies were splashing
in the lake, she took from beneath the rim
of the chariot, where she had secreted it, a
druidical fairy wand. This had been given
her by a Dedannan druid, and was a dreadful
thing to possess, for its power was of the black
magic, against which nothing might prevail.
Going to the side of the clear water, she struck
lightly with the wand the shoulder of each of
the four children; and, as she touched Fionula,
Lir’s fair young daughter became a beautiful
snow-white swan, and as she touched Aed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Fiachra and Conn, Lir’s three young sons
were changed like unto Fionula.</p>

<p>A cry of lamentation arose from the witnesses
of this deed, though none guessed that
the ill was so dreadful and beyond the reach
of druidic skill, nor did the children know at
first what evil had befallen them, but swam to
and fro laughing in their hearts, and rejoicing
in their white feathers and in their swift joy
in the water. But when Fionula heard the
lamentation, and looked upon the evil face of
Aeifa her stepmother, she knew that the hour
of doom had come.</p>

<p>Then Aeifa stretched out her arms, and
chanted these words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">“Lost far and wide on Darvra’s gloomy water,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">With other lonely birds tost far and wide.</div>
   <div class="verse">For nevermore shall Lir behold his daughter,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">And never shall his sons lie by his side.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Then while all on the shore stood in deep
grief, Fionula swam close, and looked up into
the white face of Aeifa, which was whiter then
than the whitest breast-feathers of these poor
bewildered swans.</p>

<p>“This is an evil deed thou hast done, O
Aeifa,” she said. “Out of a bitter heart thou
hast wrought this cruel wrong upon us who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
love thee, and have never done or wished thee
ill. Nevertheless it is not our ill that shall
endure for ever, but thine own evil. There
shall be an avenging terrible for thee, whensoever
it come.”</p>

<p>It was then that Fionula for the first time
sang as a swan, and even then the marvellous
sweet singing brought both gladness and tears
into the hearts of those who heard.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">“In the years long ago, long ago now, long ago,</div>
   <div class="verse">We were loved by her who dooms us to this evil cruel woe:</div>
   <div class="verse indent8">Who with magic wand and words</div>
   <div class="verse indent8">Hath changed us into birds&mdash;</div>
   <div class="verse">Snow-white swans to drift and drift for evermore</div>
   <div class="verse">Homeless, weary, tempest-baffled hence from shore to shore.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="in0">A silence followed this melancholy singing.
Then at last Fionula spoke again.</p>

<p>“Tell us, O Aeifa, how long this doom is to
be upon us, so that we may know when death
shall come to take away our suffering?”</p>

<p>Then because in that day it was not honourable
to refuse the truth when asked, Aeifa did
as Fionula prayed of her.</p>

<p>“Better would it be for thee and thy brothers
to know nothing and to hope much. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
since thou hast asked this thing I will tell it:</p>

<p>“Three hundred years shall ye, Fionula,
and Aed and Fiachra and Conn, who are now
four white swans, abide here on this great
lonely, desolate lake of Darvra. For three
hundred years thereafter shall ye inhabit the
wild sea of Moyle, which lies between the Stairway
of the Giants, and the bleak shores of
the great headland of Alba.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> And for yet
another three hundred years ye shall drift to
and fro among the storm-swept seas off the
rocky isles to the west of Erin.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, ye shall be idle sport for the
storms until Lairgnen, a great prince of the
north, has union with Decca, in the south:
until the Taillkenn,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> the new prophet, shall
come to Erin and preach a new faith that shall
chase away the old gods: and until ye shall be
filled with fear and wonder at a strange sound,
that shall be the ringing of the first Christian
bell. All this I tell ye because of the prophetic
sight I have, and that has come to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
through the druidic wand wherewith I have
changed ye into four wild white swans. And
this too, I say unto ye, Fionula and Aed and
Fiachra and Conn, that neither by your own
power nor by your prayers, nor by mine, nor
by the power of Lir and Bove Derg, nor by
that of all kings and princes and druids whatsoever;
no, nor by any god, nor by any power
in heaven or earth, can ye be freed from this
spell I have put upon ye, until the times and
events I have spoken of shall be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>When Aeifa had ceased speaking, there was
no sound to be heard, save the lap-lapping of
the lake-water upon the shore. Of the company
of those with her none spake a word, each
dreading the evil that was sure to come. At
last a faint sobbing came from amid the sedges,
where the young brothers nestled by the side
of Fionula, who had already begun to mother
these dear ones whom she loved.</p>

<p>When she heard these sobs, Aeifa’s heart
smote her. Even if she would, she could not
now undo the age-long spell she had set
upon the children of Lir. But one thing was
left to her that she might do with the fairy
wand, which could be moved once again if
stirred by the breath of her will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>“Hearken, O children of Lir,” she cried,
“for I have yet one thing to say: and that
out of the sorrow in my heart because of
the doom I have put upon ye. Although
ye are turned into wild swans, ye shall not
become as the desert birds, and have no
speech but the savage screams and cries of
the wilderness. Ye shall keep for ever your
own sweet Gaelic speech, and so be able to
talk each with the other, and with any of the
human kind whom ye may meet. And more
than this, ye shall be able to sing the most
sweet, plaintive songs, and the most wild,
haunting music that ever man has heard; so
that all whose ears list shall be lulled into
deep sleep, or into a peace sweeter than slumber
itself. Nor shall the law of the soulless
brutes be upon you, but ye shall be Fionula
and Aed and Fiachra and Conn, the children
of Lir.”</p>

<p>Having said these words, Aeifa raised her
arms and chanted this song:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">“Speed hence, speed hence, O lone white swans,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Across the wind-sprent foam;</div>

   <div class="verse">And the wind alone shall kiss your brow,</div>

  </div>

   <div class="verse">Three hundred years on the wilder west,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Speed hence, speed hence, O lone white swans,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">And Lir shall call in vain;</div>
   <div class="verse">For all his aching heart and tears,</div>
   <div class="verse">For all the weariness of his years,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Ye shall not come again.</div>
  </div>

   <div class="verse">Speed hence, speed hence, O lone white swans,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Till the ringing of Christ’s bell;</div>

   <div class="verse">And Death shall take ye to his breast</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">At the ringing of Christ’s bell.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Having sung this farewell song, Aeifa ordered
the horses to be yoked again to her
chariot.</p>

<p>This done, she drove away westward, nor
was there a single heart in those who accompanied
her but was filled with sorrow and
foreboding.</p>

<p>When the lake was no longer visible, and
the gloom of the mountains came down upon
the pass which led towards the westlands
where Bove Derg dwelled, a faint wild aerial
singing was heard, delicate as tinkling cowbells
on far hill-pastures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Before Aeifa drew near to the great dun
of Bove Derg, she put each of her company
under a solemn bond of silence as to what
she had meant to do and not done, and as to
what later she had done; and because of the
lealty of the bond to a woman, and also because
of the fear of each towards the druidical
fairy wand that she still carried, the oath was
taken by one and all.</p>

<p>Therefore it was easy for Aeifa to mislead
Bove Derg as to the reason why she had not
brought the children of Lir with her. Nevertheless
he doubted greatly that his foster-daughter
deceived him, for he could not think
that Lir his friend would so mistrust him as
to refuse to let Fionula and her brothers
accompany their stepmother.</p>

<p>So, secretly, he sent a swift messenger
across the hills and straths to the dun of
Lir.</p>

<p>Lir was at once wroth and filled with fear
when he heard that Aeifa had reached the
dun of Bove Derg without the children.
Some treachery surely had been done, he
cried.</p>

<p>Then, calling together a company, he set
forth with all speed. Towards sundown, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
cavalcade came upon the wide desolate shores
of the great lake of Darvra.</p>

<p>“What is that sound?” cried Lir.</p>

<p>“It is the wind in the reeds, O Lir,”
answered a spearman by his side.</p>

<p>“The wind in the reeds is a sweet sound
to hear, Coran, but never have I heard any
wind that could make so sweet a music.”</p>

<p>“It is the little gentle lapping of the wavelets
by the west wind, O Lir.”</p>

<p>“It is no gentle lapping of the wavelets by
the west wind, Coran, nor yet is it the wind
in the reeds; but that is the voice of Fionula
singing.”</p>

<p>And as the sound grew clearer, all heard
it, and soon the words were audible:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse quote">“Behold the Danann host is on the shore,</div>
   <div class="verse">Seeking for those now lost for evermore;</div>
   <div class="verse">But let us haste towards that proud array</div>
   <div class="verse">And tell the tidings of this fatal day.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And while the song was still in the ears
of all there, Lir gave a great cry and pointed
to where above the midmost of the lake four
wild swans were winging swiftly towards the
eastern shore.</p>

<p>When he heard from Fionula&mdash;and he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
her voice, which was sweeter than any other
he had ever heard&mdash;of all that had happened,
and of the strange and dreadful doom that
was put upon her and her brothers, he fell
sobbing to the ground. From all his company
the keening of a bitter lamentation
arose.</p>

<p>Alas, as he knew well, not even the great
length of years which the Dedannan folk lived&mdash;and
a score of years is to them what one
year is to us&mdash;would enable him to see his
dear ones again. Three hundred years on
Darvra, these he might mayhap live to see;
but not the three hundred years on the bleak
and wild region of the Moyle, nor the three
hundred on the wild tempestuous western seas,
nor the far-off day when a prophet called
Taillken would come to Erin with a new faith,
and in the glens and across the plains would
be heard the strange chiming of Christ’s
bell.</p>

<p>Yet was he comforted when he heard that
his children were to keep their Gaelic speech,
and to be human in all things save only in
their outward shape. And glad he was that
they were to be able to chant music so wild
and sweet that all who should hear it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
be filled with joy and peace. For music is
the most beautiful and wonderful thing in
the world, and is the oldest, as it will be
the latest speech.</p>

<p>“Remain with us this night, here by the
lake,” said Fionula, “and we shall sing to you
our fairy music.”</p>

<p>So all abode there, and so sweet was the
song of the children of Lir, that he himself
and all his company fell into a deep, restful
slumber. All night long they sang their sweet
sad song, and were glad because of the quiet
dark figures by the lake-side lying drowned
in shadow. Slowly the moon sank behind the
hills. Then the stars glistened whitelier and
smaller, and a soft rosy flush came over the
mountain crest in the east. Then Lir awoke,
and Fionula and Aed and Fiachra and Conn
ceased their singing, and spread out their
white pinions to the light of a new day, and
ruffled their snowy breasts against the frothing
that the dawn-wind made upon the lake.</p>

<p>Lir took a harp from one of his followers,
and sang a song of farewell to his children.
At that singing all awoke, and the heart of
each man was heavy because of the doom that
had fallen upon the children of Lir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>He sang of the fateful hour when he had
taken Aeifa to wife, and of the cruel hardness
of her heart, that thus out of jealous rage she
could work so great and unmerited evil. And
what rest could there be for him, he chanted,
since whenever he lay down in the dark he
would see his loved ones pictured plain before
him: Fionula, his pride and joy; Aed, so agile
and adventurous; the laughing Fiachra; and
little Conn, with his curls of gold.</p>

<p>Then with a heavy heart indeed Lir went
on his way. Before he and his company
entered the great pass at the western end of
Lough Darvra, he looked back longingly. In
the blue space of heaven he saw four white
cloudlets drifting idly in a slow circling
flight.</p>

<p>“O Fionula,” he cried, “O Aed, O Fiachra,
O Conn, farewell, my little ones! Well do
I know that you have risen thus in high flight
so that my eyes may have this last glimpse
of you. Nevertheless I will come again
soon.”</p>

<p>It was a weary journey thence to the dun
of Bove Derg, but all weariness was forgotten
in wrath against Aeifa.</p>

<p>No sooner had Lir spoken to the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
no sooner had the king looked at the face
of Aeifa as she heard the accusation, than
Bove Derg knew that the truth had been told,
and that Aeifa was guilty of this cruel wrong.
Turning to his foster-daughter, he exclaimed,
in the hearing of all:</p>

<p>“This ill deed that thou hast wrought, Aeifa,
will be worse for thee than all thou hast put
upon the children of Lir. For in the end they
shall know joy and peace, while as long as the
world lasts thou shalt know what it is to be
lonely and accursed and abhorred.” Then for
a brief time Bove Derg brooded. There was
naught in all the world so dreaded in the dim
ancient days as the demons of the air, and
no doom could be more dreadful than to be
transformed into one of those dark and lonely
and desperate spirits that make night and desolate
places so full of terror. At last the king
rose. Taking his druidical magic wand, he
struck Aeifa with it, and therewith turned her
into a demon of the air. A great cry went up
from the whole assemblage as they saw Aeifa
spread out gaunt shadowy wings, and struggle
as in a sudden anguish of new birth. The
next moment she gave a terrible scream, and
flew upward like a swirling eagle, and disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
among the dark lowering clouds
which hung over the land that day.</p>

<p>Thus was it that Aeifa became a demon o
the air. Even now her screaming voice may
be heard among the wild hills of her own land,
on dark windy nights, when tempests break, or
in disastrous hours.</p>

<p>But out of a wrong done the gods may
work good. So was it with the Dedannans.</p>

<p>For not only Lir, and all his people, but
Bove Derg and a great part of the nation assembled
by the shores of Lake Darvra, and
there pitched their tents, which afterwards
grew into a vast rath, wherein the king builded
a mighty dun.</p>

<p>For Lir and Bove Derg had vowed that
henceforth they would live their years by the
shores of Darvra, where they might converse
with their dear ones, and where they might
listen to the sweet oblivious songs which
Fionula and her brothers sang to the easing
of the heart, and the silence of all pain and
weariness.</p>

<p>But so great was the rumour of this marvel
that all Erin heard of it. The Milesians in
the south agreed to a long truce of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
hundred years; and came and dwelt in amity
with the Dedannans, for they too loved the
sweet and wonderful music of the white swans
that were the children of Lir.</p>

<p>“Three hundred years yet may we live,”
said Bove Derg to Lir, “and as I am a king,
I swear never to leave the lough of Darvra
while the four swans that are thy sons and
daughter inhabit it. The heavy years shall
pass for us, listening to their beautiful sweet
singing; and therein we shall know peace and
joy.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Lir, and he spoke the truth,
for in that day the Dedannans lived to a great
age; some say to three hundred, some to five,
some to seven hundred years.</p>

<p>The years went by, one after the other, and
by tens and by scores, and still Lir and Bove
Derg and the Dedannans and Milesians
dwelled by the shores of Lake Darvra. For
never in the world’s history has there been
chronicle of so sweet a singing as that of the
four children of Lir. All day the swans discoursed
lovingly with their father and Bove
Derg, and their kith and kin, and all who
sought them; and each night they sang their
slow, sweet, fairy music&mdash;a music so wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
and passing sweet, that all who listed to it
forgot weariness and pain and bitter memories
and the burden of years, and fell into a deep
restful slumber, whence they awoke each morrow
as though they had drunken overnight of
the Fountain of Youth.</p>

<p>The hair of Lir and Bove Derg was long
and white, and almost had the Dedannans and
the Milesians forgotten their ancient enmity,
when a day of the days came whereon Fionula
called aside her three brothers.</p>

<p>“Dear brothers,” she said, as she looked
sadly at the three beautiful white swans, and
at the four drifting shadow-swans in the depths
of the lake, “dear brothers, do you know that
the time has come when we must put away our
happiness as a dream that has been dreamed?
For now the three hundred years of our sojourn
here are at an end, and at dawn to-morrow we
must arise and wing our sad flight across the
dear lands of Erin, till we come to the wild
and stormy waters of the sea-stream of the
Moyle.”</p>

<p>Aed and Fiachra and Conn made so loud
and bitter lamentation at this that all heard,
and soon the whole host that was encamped
there filled the region with long keening cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of grief, and a sorrowful mourning strain as of
the melancholy wind among the hills.</p>

<p>But once more all were soothed that night
into deep slumber and happy peace, because of
the slow, sweet, fairy music of the chanting
swans.</p>

<p>At dawn, the four swans arose, and with
their white pinions circled high above the
lake, glittering as they soared into the sunflood
as it swept across the summits of the eastern
hills.</p>

<p>“Farewell! farewell! farewell!” they chanted,
and at that sad sound all the Dedannan host
and all the Milesians, headed by Lir and Bove
Derg, kneeled along the lake pastures and
amid the reeds and sedges.</p>

<p>Then Fionula, as she and her brothers slowly
descended in wide-sweeping curves, sang this
song:</p>

</div>

<p>As Fionula ceased this song, she and her
brothers swept so close to the water’s edge
that their white wings made a little dazzle of
spray. Then with swift pinions they rose
again, and soared in great spirals of flight, till
they gleamed against the morning blue like
four white banners adrift before a skiey
wind.</p>

<p>Then for a brief while they suspended on
outspread wings, and looked longingly down
upon the dear ones and all their kith and kin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
who on their part could scarce see the four
white swans for the mist of tears that was before
all faces.</p>

<p>Suddenly they swung hither and thither, like
foam tossed by a tidal wind, and then flew
straight to the northward. Soon they were
but white specks; then the blue closed in upon
them, as the wastes of the sea close at last
behind the hulls of drifting ships.</p>

<p>Before the torch of a stormy sun sank that
night amid the tossed green billows of the
Moyle, there where the sea flows to and fro
betwixt Erin and Alba, the children of Lir
drooped their weary wings. Their home now
was the running wave. In darkness and loneliness
and sorrow, they floated close to each
other, waiting for the dawn to steal into that
first night of bitter exile.</p>

<p>From that day they were severed from those
who loved them. Of a truth, there was keening
and lamentation and sorrow by the shores
of the lough of Darvra. At the last, as the
snow melts, the great host of the Dedannans
and Milesians passed away: to the westward,
some; others, to the south.</p>

<p>As for Bove Derg and Lir, their white hairs
and the grey ashes of their lives were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
mournful refrain of many a song on the lips of
wandering bards.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There were tears in the eyes of Peterkin
when Ian Mor ceased speaking. His heart
was sore because of Fionula and Aed and
Fiachra and Conn.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he too would be glad to be a
swan for a time, if only so as to be able to
soar into the blue spaces of the sky, and to
spread white wings over the dancing waters,
and to move through them swifter than any
boat. With what joy he had once climbed on
to the fan of an old windmill, and slowly revolved
through the hot August air, which
winnowed around him a coolness like the flowing
of wind over the summit of a hill.</p>

<p>A bright shining came into his eyes, then
laughter bubbled to his lips.</p>

<p>Eilidh looked at him, half in mock reproof,
half rejoicingly.</p>

<p>“Peterkin, why do you laugh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for sure, dear, it’s not laughing I am
at the poor swans, but at the face of Old Nanny,
my nurse, when she came out of the cottage in
the glen and saw me lying flat and holding on
to the fan of the windmill, with my hair all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
blown back, and both my legs hanging in the
air.”</p>

<p>“Some day you will kill yourself, Peterkin,”
said Eilidh gravely.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll be a swan! and I’ll fly round and
round Iona, and whenever you or Ian want
to go to the mainland, I’ll take you on my
back.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Peterkin sprang to his feet, and
jumped to and fro, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>“Ah, how I would love it!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Love what, dearie?”</p>

<p>“Love to see Ian fall off my back and go
plump in among the herrings in the Sound!
<em>What</em> a splash he would make!”</p>

<p>“And poor Ian&mdash;&mdash; Why, he might be
drowned, Peterkin!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I would swoop down the way a
gannet does when it sees a fish, and would
scoop him up with my bill.”</p>

<p>The picture was too much for Peterkin.
The thought of grabbing the dripping half-drowned
Ian in his bill, and of soaring away
with him to the white dry sands, was better
than any dream of the fairies he had ever had,
even than that when he rode a fairy horse in
the guise of a white mouse, with grasshoppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
for hounds, and a great bumble-bee as a wild
boar for the occasion. He threw himself on
the floor in front of the hearth, and rolled
over and over, contorting his small body into
alarming convulsions, clapping his hands, and
laughing, laughing, laughing.</p>

<p>Eilidh, too, let the laughter take her, and
then Ian found it sweet; and soon the little
room was full of joyous laughter upon laughter,
and of the leaping flame-light from the blazing
log on the peats, and of the dancing of the
shadow-men in the corners and up and down
the walls.</p>

<p>“The swans! The swans!” cried Peterkin
suddenly, as he grabbed wildly at some shadowy
shapes which slid along the floor. But these
swans proved as tantalising as the wind-shadows
on the grass which so often he chased,
and suddenly in a flash they disappeared altogether.
They seemed to spring right into Ian
Mor; at any rate it was in his arms that Peterkin
found himself.</p>

<p>“Where are the shadows? Where are the
shadows, Ian?” he cried: “I believe you are
hiding them inside yourself! Where are they?
Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Why, you boykin, where could they be?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>“They are in your heart, Ian! I know they
are! I see them! I see them!”</p>

<p>Ian glanced at Eilidh. Then, putting his
arm round Peterkin, he laid his lips against his
downy cheek and whispered:</p>

<p>“Yes, my little lad, you’ve guessed right.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you chase them out, Ian?”</p>

<p>Again Ian Mor glanced at Eilidh.</p>

<p>“They live there, lennavan-mo. They
jumped out because of your laughter, but they
are back now.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll be laughing often, Ian dear, and
some day I’ll catch them and drive them out
into the sunshine, and then they’ll melt&mdash;ay,
ay, they’ll melt for sure, Ian, and what will you
be after doing then?”</p>

<p>“Well, like Fionula and the wild swans,
Peterkin, I’ll rise up and soar away on the
great flood of the sun across the sea till I come
to Hy Brásil, the Isle of Youth far away in
the West.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Peterkin said gravely: “Hy
Brásil: Eilidh told me that is where she and
you are going to live. Will you take me there
too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will come there too, mochree,
some day.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>“But with you &mdash; when you and Eilidh
go?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll not be going there together,
Peterkin. But we won’t be forgetting our dear
little Peterkin. We’ll be on the shore looking
out for you when you come.”</p>

<p>“Why are your eyes wet, Ian, and Eilidh’s
too?”</p>

<p>“Why, you unfeeling little wretch, it’s because
we have left the poor swans, Fionula, and Aed,
and Fiachra, and Conn, alone on the rough
seas of the Moyle all this while.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, tell me now about the children of
Lir. Did they see any one up there? Were
they ever happy?”</p>

<p>“Eilidh knows the rest of the story as well
as I do, Peterkin, so go and sit in her lap while
she tells it to you and to me.”</p>

<p>With that, Ian Mor rose and put another log
on the red peats. A shower of sparks shot up
into the dark hollow of the chimney. Peterkin
laughed.</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Eilidh, with smiling
eyes: and then in her sweet, low voice resumed
the tale of the Children of Lir, from where Ian
had stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>It was at the edge of winter when Fionula
and her brothers reached the wild bleak seas of
the Moyle.</p>

<p>At first there was no too bitter cold or too
fierce tempestuousness to make their evil lot
still more hard to bear; but sad indeed were
their hearts as day after day they saw nothing
but the same grey skies, the same grey wastes
and dark sullen waves, the same bleak, rocky
coasts inhabited only by the cormorant and the
sea-mew. Never to see a familiar face, never
to hear a familiar voice: to dwell from morning
dusk till evening dark in loneliness and sorrow&mdash;that,
indeed, was a hard fate upon the four
children of Lir. From hunger and cold, too,
they suffered much. No longer could they be
cheered as they were on Lough Darvra, and
often and often they lamented that their doom
could not have permitted them to remain as
swans indeed, but as swans on that now dear
and home-sweet inland sea of Darvra.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, but while their misery
and want did not grow less they were not yet
tortured by wintry storms and bitter frosts.</p>

<p>But one forlorn afternoon a terrible congregation
of clouds, black and heavy and flanked
with livid gleams, appeared above the horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and slowly invaded the whole west, and then
all the sky northward and all southward.</p>

<p>Fionula saw that a great tempest was nigh,
so she called Aed, and Fiachra, and Conn, to
come to her side.</p>

<p>“Dear brothers,” she exclaimed, “the storm
that will soon be upon us will be worse than
any we have yet known. Hardly can we hope
not to be driven far apart. Let us agree,
therefore, to meet somewhere, if so be that we
are not utterly destroyed. For though Aeifa,
our cruel stepmother, doomed us to these long
ages of suffering, it may well be that even her
potent spell is not strong enough against death:
and death may come to us through famine, or
cold, or in the drowning wave.”</p>

<p>At first the brothers could answer nothing.
Then Aed spoke. “Thou art wise, dear
Fionula. Let us, then, fix upon the rocky isle
of Carrick-na-ron, as that place is well known
to each of us, and can be descried from a great
way off.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that Carrick-na-ron was made
their place of meeting, if so be that in the blind
fury and confusion of the tempest they should
be driven the one from the other.</p>

<p>This was well: for that night, with the darkening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of the night into a hollow of starless
blackness, a terrible tempest swept over the
seas, and lashed them into foam and into vast
heaving, rolling, swaying billows. Amid the
noise of the waves, and behind the screaming
of the wind, the four weary rain-drenched bewildered
swans could hear the crashing of the
thunder and see the wild fitful blue glare of
savage lightnings.</p>

<p>Before midnight they were whirled this way
and that by the fierce paws of the gale. Soon
they were separated, and with despairing cries,
each swept solitary through the night. In the
heart of each of the children of Lir there was
little hope of any morrow. All nearly died of
weariness and despair. Nevertheless dawn
broke at last, and with the first coming of light
the tempest passed away.</p>

<p>When the sun rose the waters were almost
smooth again. A sparkling came into the crest
of every wave. The sea blued.</p>

<p>Fionula was the first to descry the rocky isle
of Carrick-na-ron, and gladly she swam towards
it, for she was now too weary to fly. Eagerly
she hoped to find her brothers there, safe-havened.
Alas, there was not a sign of any,
not even when she flew to the summit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
highest rock and looked far and wide across
the wilderness of waters.</p>

<p>Great sorrow was hers, for sure, when she
beheld nothing but wave upon wave, wave
upon wave, till on the far horizon the long low
line of sea climbed into the sky.</p>

<p>A song of mourning broke from Fionula, so
sad and sweet and despairing that the gannets
and sea-mews and dark fierce cormorants
wheeled around Carrick-na-ron, wondering at
the marvel of this wild swan, with the strange
remote voice of the human kind. It was a
song of farewell.</p>

<p>When Fionula ceased her lament she looked
once more across the wastes of the sea. Suddenly
she uttered a glad cry, for she descried
Conn swimming slowly towards the rocky isle,
slowly, and with drooping head, for he was
drenched with the salt brine, and so weary that
he could scarce move.</p>

<p>Hardly had she welcomed him with joy, and
helped him to reach a flat ledge of rock
whereon the sunlight poured with healing
warmth, than she saw Fiachra desperately
striving to make his way towards them, but so
far spent that it seemed as though death would
overtake him before he reached the foam-edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
rocks. Fionula sprang into the running wave,
and soon was beside Fiachra, aiding him to her
utmost. With difficulty she helped him to the
ledge where Conn crouched in the sun, but so
weak was he that when he was spoken to he
could utter no word in reply. Fionula looked
with pity upon her two young brothers. It
was hard for her to see their unmothered pain
and weariness. So she spread out her broad
white pinions, and gave the warmth of her
body to the two drenched and shivering swans.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, as she crouched on
the ledge, with Fiachra nestling by her right
side and Conn by her left; “ah! if only Aed
were here too, all might yet be well. And
even if it be death, sweeter far that we might
all perish together.” It was as though her
loving prayer were answered, for before long
she descried Aed swimming swiftly through the
sunny foam-splashed seas. He, at least, she
saw with joy, had not suffered as his younger
brothers had done, for he came on with head
erect and his white plumage all unruffled and
dazzlingly ashine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Aed, too, was glad to rest in
the sunshine, so Fionula placed him under her
breast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>Noon found them thus: Fionula with sad
eyes staring out across the wastes of windy
seas; under the warm feathers of her breast,
Aed; and close nestled to the warm down of
her sides, Fiachra and Conn. She heard their
low breathing as they slept, and that they
might sleep the deeper and longer she sang
her low, sweet, fairy music:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

   <div class="verse indent2">Nothing so sweet lies hid in all your years.</div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This and other songs Fionula chanted low
throughout the day, till at last she too was
overcome by her weariness; and she slept.</p>

<p>At the rising of the moon, all awoke. Full
glad were Aed and Fiachra and Conn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
their tribulation was over; only Fionula knew
that the doom which Aeifa had put upon them
held worse things, and many, in store for them.</p>

<p>For some days thereafter there was peace.
Then a snow-whisper came, and the inland hills
and the peaked summits of the isles were
white. The cold grew deeper day by day; at
each dawn the frost bit with a keener grip.
The bitter hardships of the children of Lir were
now more almost than they could bear. Nevertheless,
they had a yet more dreadful trial to
endure: for at mid-winter there came a tempest
of whirling snow and icy wind so fierce and
terrible, that for a day and a night the waves
were strewn with the dead bodies of sea-mews
and terns. Nothing the four swans had ever
suffered was like unto what they suffered at
this time.</p>

<p>But when Fionula had again found and sheltered
her dear ones, and mothered them with
her great love, she knew that whatever their
sufferings they would now surely endure until
the end. Had they been subject to the mortal
law, they could not have survived that dreadful
day, and still more awful night.</p>

<p>And so another year passed. The worst
sorrow of the children of Lir was their great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
loneliness, a thing more bitter than hunger or
thirst or any privation. They longed for their
kind as the first white flowers of the year long
for the sun. When mid-winter came again a
terrible frost arose. All the north isles were
like black bosses in a gleaming shield, for
sheets of ice covered the seas, and each island
was gripped as in an iron vice. Day by day
the cold grew more terrible. On the morrow of
the ninth day the four children of Lir thought
that the end of their misery was at hand. The
whole sea was one solid floor of ice; the isle of
Carrick-na-ron, where they were, was like a
black iceberg; into ice lapsed each faint failing
breath that they drew with ever greater pain.</p>

<p>Each morning they had waked to find their
feet frozen to the rock, and even the edges of
their wings; and a bitter thing it was to tear
themselves free, and to leave clinging to the
rock the soft feathers of their breasts and the
outer quills of their wings and the skin of their
feet.</p>

<p>How fain each was of death! How gladly
they would have passed away from the world
of the living, though in exile, and longing with
aching hearts to see once more their own dear
land and the faces of those whom they loved!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
But their doom was on them, and they could
not leave the sea of Moyle, nor could they win
death.</p>

<p>The brave heart of Fionula knew this. She
knew too what cruel pain it would give her and
her brothers to swim through the salt seas with
their bleeding wounds, for the brine would
enter them and cause agony. Nevertheless,
she led them forth towards the coast of the
mainland. There they found a fjord and a
haven amid the pine-clad shores, and before
long their wounds were healed, and the feathers
on their wings and breasts grew again.</p>

<p>But of what avail to tell the tale of all their
years? Fionula saw that while they must ever
return each night to the sea of Moyle till the
three hundred years were over and done, they
might fly as far and wide as they could between
dawn and dusk. Mighty and strong were they
now upon the wing, and fit to endure the slashing
of rains, the buffetings of wild winds, the
whirling briny sleet of the seas, and the cold
of the high forlorn spaces of the lonely sky.</p>

<p>Far and wide therefore they roamed, sometimes
along the foam-swept headlands of Alba,
sometimes by the stormy coasts of Erin, sometimes
for leagues and leagues out into the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
dim wilderness, wherein, so men said, Hy
Brásil lay&mdash;Hy Brásil, the Isle of Rest, the
Isle of Joy, the Isle of Youth Eternal.</p>

<p>One day, far in the oblivion of these selfsame
years, they chanced to be flying past the
mouth of the Bann, on the north coast of
Erin: and Aed gave a cry of joy, and bade
Fionula and his brothers look inland, for there,
coming out of the south-west, was a stately
cavalcade, the horsemen mounted on white
steeds, beautifully apparelled, and with weapons
gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p>How joyous it was to see their own kind
again! All gave a cry of rapture, their hearts
aching the while that they could not set foot
upon the land, as that was forbidden to them,
though they might adventure to the shore.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly Fionula looked, but
she could not tell who the strangers were.</p>

<p>“Keen are your eyes, Aed,” she said; “can
you discern who the men of yonder cavalcade
are?”</p>

<p>“I know them not as men: but it seems to
me that they are a troop of our own Dedannan
folk, or perchance they may be of the Milesians.”</p>

<p>But while they were still wondering and discussing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the cavalcade drew nearer, and the
men of it saw the four swans, and, recognising
them as the children of Lir, made signs to
Fionula and her brothers to alight on the
shore.</p>

<p>With joy the Dedannans, for so they were,
hailed the poor exiles, for whom indeed they
had long been seeking along the north coasts
of Erin. As for the children of Lir they
could scarce speak, so great was their happiness
to hear their dear familiar speech once
more and to see the faces of their own
people.</p>

<p>Again and again they were embraced by
the two chiefs of the Fairy Host, as the
Dedannan warriors were called&mdash;Aed the
keen-witted, and Fergus the chess-player,
the two sons of Bove Derg, king of the
Tuatha-De-Danann.</p>

<p>With joy the children of Lir learned that
their father was still alive, and was even then
celebrating at his house at Shee Finnaha,
along with Bove Derg and the chiefs of the
Dedannans, the Feast of Age. As for
Aed and Fergus and all their following, they
wept when they heard the tale of the misery
of these lost years, when Fionula and Aed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and Fiachra and Conn were the sport of the
winds.</p>

<p>While eagerly and lovingly they were conversing,
none noticed that the sun was sinking
upon the low wavering line of the ultimate
wave. But when at last Fionula saw this,
she uttered a sad cry of warning to her
brothers, and all four rose on their white
wings and made ready to fly back to the bleak
and desolate sea of Moyle. And sad, sadder
than ever, was the heart of Fionula, for she
knew that they could not be there till nightfall,
and that the penalty of this would be that
they should not again see the face of their
kind, either on the shores of Erin or Alba,
until the end of the three hundred years on the
wastes of the Moyle.</p>

<p>As they circled in the air, she sang this
song, the last of the swan-songs heard of any
of the Dedannans who were in that company:</p>

<p>A great lamentation went up from the cavalcade
of the Fairy Host when Fionula ended
this song, and she and her brothers flew
swiftly northward athwart the waves, red and
wild because of the stormy setting of the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>Sad was the tale the Dedannans had to
relate when they returned to Shee Finnaha.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bove Derg, the aged king,
and white-haired Lir himself, took comfort in
this, that Fionula and her brothers were still
alive. Moreover, they knew that in the end
the spell of Aeifa would be broken and that
the exiles would be freed from their sufferings.</p>

<p>But often, often, they thought with tears, as
the slow revolving seasons lapsed one into the
other, of the children of Lir upon the desolate
far seas of the Moyle.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Here Eilidh’s voice lapsed into silence.
Then, looking no longer at Peterkin, but
staring into the red heart of the peats, she
sang a Gaelic song, called the Sorrow of the
Grey Hairs of Lir.</p>

<p>Peterkin never loved Eilidh so well as when
she sang; but he was sorrowful to-night when
he saw that the song brought tears into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Eilidh,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, Peterkin, dear.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you be liking to kiss Ian?”</p>

<p>Eilidh laughed low, a faint flush coming and
going upon her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>“For why, boykin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that whenever you have tears
in your eyes Ian can chase them away. I have
seen him kiss you when you are tired.”</p>

<p>At this Ian Mor rose and lifted Peterkin in
his arms.</p>

<p>“Eilidh is thinking of something sad, Peterkin;
that is all. See, she is smiling now, and
laughing too by the same token.” The boy
tossed his curls, and with a roguish smile
added:</p>

<p>“Ah, that is just because I said she wanted
to kiss you.”</p>

<p>“You’re much too wise, Peterkin. But
there, down with you! Now run to the door,
and tell me if it is still raining.”</p>

<p>Peterkin never could go straight anywhere,
for his progress was ever like that of a kid or
lambkin, a series of jumps and little sudden
runs. No sooner was he gone, than Ian turned
to Eilidh, and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” he whispered, “that little
burst o’ sunshine is right. A kiss from your
lips is the best thing to chase away the tears.
But why are you sad, mochree?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the sorrow of old Lir;
and how little it matters whether one live fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
years or five hundred, as these old Dedannans
did. Then suddenly the thought flashed
across me that some day soon we should lose
Peterkin: he too will become a wild swan, and
it will be we who shall hear the far-off singing
of his laughing childhood.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will take his childhood with
him into manhood, dear. Let him look often
into your beautiful eyes, Eilidh, and the little
one will learn much without knowing that he
is learning. And then, too, to be near you:
why, that is to be a child always deep down,
and to have sunshine in the heart and mind&mdash;for
have you forgotten your name, ‘Sunshine’?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Ian Mor leaned and kissed
her. Puzzled at the sudden radiant smile on
her face, he looked round. There was Peterkin,
sitting squatted on the hearth, with an
impish smile in his blue eyes. He had crawled
behind the hanging curtain at the door, and
unseen and unheard gained the fireside.</p>

<p>With a joyous laugh he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ian, you and your rain! Is it not
hearing you are? It’s on the window as if
the brownies were throwing little wee stones.
It was not the rain you were wanting, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
a kiss from Eilidh! Now, Eilidh, tell me
true?”</p>

<p>“Tell you true, Blumpits. Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But here Peterkin, overcome by some
sudden memory suggested by the pet name
which Eilidh sometimes gave him, went dancing
round the room, laughing and chuckling by
turns, and once and again clapping his hands
in elfin glee.</p>

<p>“Eilidh, Eilidh,” he cried, “do tell me again
that story of Blumpits and the Bunnywig.”</p>

<p>Ian looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“What’s a bunnywig, Blumpits?”</p>

<p>“A bunnywig&mdash;you’re not for knowing what
a bunnywig is&mdash;and you, Ian Mor, too! A
bunnywig is a <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">kunak</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>“And what did Blumpits do?”</p>

<p>“He got on the bunnywig, in the green fern,
and rode on it into fairyland, and no one saw
him go but a squirrel. But no, Eilidh, I am
not wanting to hear about that now; and don’t
be looking at my bed there, for I haven’t got
the sleep upon me yet. Tell me the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the tale about Fionula and Aed and Fiachra
and Conn.”</p>

<p>“I wonder, now, if that’s because you really
want to hear, or if it’s because you don’t want
to be sent to bed?”</p>

<p>Peterkin had kicked aside his shoes, and
taken off his socks, and was warming his feet
at the fire. His body was bent nearly double,
as he looked round, clutching the while his big
toe in the hollow of his tiny fist.</p>

<p>“O Eilidh,” he said reproachfully, but with
a light of such mischief in his eyes that Eilidh
laughed. Then stooping, she took him on her
lap, and after a few seconds, when all three
looked idly and dreamily into the red fanwave
in the heart of the peats, her lips moved again
to the sorrowful sweet tale of the Children of
Lir.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Year after year passed for the four swans
that were the children of Lir. On that bleak
and lonely sea of the Moyle they saw none of
their own kind from year’s end to year’s end:
only the sea-mew and the cormorant, the
gannet and the tern, the slow droves of the
pollack, the travelling schools of mackerel and
herring, the swift seals migrating from isle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
isle. With each Spring they saw the great
solanders and wild swans flying northward
towards the polar seas: thence, at the first
days of winter, they saw them again flying
southward, athirst for the thin blue wine of
unfrozen seas.</p>

<p>There was no change save the changefulness
of the seasons; the grey-black wave of winter
lapsed into the grey-blue wave of spring, and
out of the dark-blue wave of summer grew the
grey-green wave of autumn.</p>

<p>Cold and hunger and weariness: these only
did not vary.</p>

<p>But at last the long weary exile on the Sea of
Moyle came to an end. One day Fionula told
her brothers that on the morrow they would
have to fly far westward, for the three hundred
years on the sea-stream of the Moyle were
over, and now they had to begin their long and
mayhap still more bitter, bleak, and mournful
exile on the wild western ocean beyond Erin.</p>

<p>“We must fly straight to the bleak headland
of Irros Domnann,” she said, “and then
must remain on the wild and desolate seas off
the isle of Glora, the island that is farthest
away from the mainland of our beloved
Erin.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>Thither, accordingly, the four swans flew on
the morrow. It was with joy that they left the
sea of the Moyle, where they had known so
much privation and misery; but little cause had
they for joy, for not less bleak were the skies,
not less desolate the coasts, not less wild the
storm-lashed, rain-swept seas, off the lifeless,
barren isle of Glora. The great waves of the
shoreless western ocean beat upon it for ever,
and their thunder often filled the darkness for
countless leagues with a sound most dreadful
to hear.</p>

<p>But after many years it chanced that a young
man, named Ebric, the son of a Dedannan lord,
came to farm a tract of land lying along the
shore of Irros Domnann. This youth, who
was a poet, and loved all beautiful things, soon
cared more for the sweet, wonderful singing of
the four swans, which often he heard, and to
see their white bodies glistening in the sun,
than to till his land.</p>

<p>One day Fionula and her brothers descried
him. Flying to the shore, they called, and
great was his wonder to hear the dear familiar
Gaelic speech in the mouths of wild swans.</p>

<p>From that time he walked daily down to the
extreme rocks on the shore, that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
converse with the children of Lir, and hear
all they had to tell of their sad story; though
he, on his part, could relate little to them of
what had happened, or was happening further
inland in Erin, though they heard from him
with sorrow that the Milesians were now
mightier than the Dedannans, and that the
Fairy Host was no longer able to withstand
the might of these enemies who long since had
come out of the south.</p>

<p>“For,” he said, “it is the way of what is
beautiful and wonderful; that the wonder
passes and the beauty fades.”</p>

<p>That night he heard Fionula singing, and
knew that the burden of her song was no other
than the saying he had uttered:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Dim face of Beauty haunting all the world,</div>
   <div class="verse">Fair face of Beauty all too fair to see,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

   <div class="verse indent8">Of ages ground to sand,</div>
   <div class="verse indent8">To a little sand.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Ebric moved homeward through the moonlight
wondering much at that song of Fionula.
But because he was a poet, he understood.</p>

<p>From him the people of the hills, and the
valleys round about Irros Domnann, heard the
story of the speaking swans; and soon the
wonder of it, and the whole sorrowful tale of
the Children of Lir became as well known in
that region as, long, long ago, to the Dedannans
and Milesians on the shores of Lough
Darvra, when they encamped by its shores
because of the slow, sweet, fairy music of the
four swans.</p>

<p>Then once again it chanced that the four children
of Lir unwittingly transgressed their doom,
and so had to leave the shores where they could
converse with the people who loved them.
But Ebric, to whom they had told everything,
was a poet, and wrought of their story a tale
so sweet and marvellous that it has lasted all
these ages, and is heard to this day on the lips
of peasants in the west of Erin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>From that time onward the sufferings of
Fionula and her brothers were no less than
they had been on the sea of the Moyle. Yet
even the worst they had there known was
surpassed midway in the heart of a terrible
winter, a winter when cattle died in covered
sheds, and men and women in their houses,
and the wild creatures of the forest under their
branches, and the storm-inured seabirds in the
hollows of their ocean-fronting cliffs.</p>

<p>On that day the whole surface of the sea
from Irros Domnann to Achill was frozen into
one solid mass of ice. Across this a polar wind
drove sheets of hail and sleet. By nightfall,
Aed and Fiachra and Conn were so far spent
that they despaired of any morrow; and at the
last Fionula herself, who had striven to comfort
them, was herself in so pitiful a misery that she
could only lament with them that death was so
long in coming.</p>

<p>But in the full horror of midnight, while they
clung nigh-frozen to the rock of Glora, Fionula
had a vision. It was of that God, that new
faith, that great wonder and beauty which was
even then coming towards Erin, though St.
Patrick had not yet set foot upon its shores.</p>

<p>“Brothers,” she cried, “take heart. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
had a vision. Of a truth our ancient gods
are but the children of a greater than they.
Aed, dear Aed and Fiachra and Conn, believe
now in this great and loving God, the most
splendid God of the living truth: for it is
He who has made all things, the pleasant,
fruitful land and the wild barren sea; and
it has been revealed to me that if we put our
trust in Him, He will comfort us and send us
help.”</p>

<p>“That we now do, O Fionula!” cried Aed
and Fiachra and Conn.</p>

<p>Thereupon they fell into a deep slumber.
When they awoke the sun was shining; the
fierce wind no longer blew; the waves danced
joyously, tossing little sheets of spray from one
to another. The bitter cold was gone, and
they rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>“It is Spring!” Aed cried, with joy.</p>

<p>“It is the answer of God,” said Fionula
gravely.</p>

<p>From that hour they had peace. Thenceforth
they suffered no more from cold or
hunger. When the savage frosts of winter, or
the wild rains of autumn, came over the western
sea, the four swans alighted on Innis
Glora, and sang their wild, sweet, beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
music, and then fell asleep, nestling side by
side, till they awoke to warmth and joy.</p>

<p>So was it till the end of the three hundred
years. Three hundred years on the lough of
Darvra; three hundred on the sea-stream of
the Moyle; three hundred on the sea of Glora,
to the west of Erin. All these ages had
they endured, and now their exile was at an
end.</p>

<p>“On the morrow, dear brothers,” Fionula
sang rejoicingly, “on the morrow we shall
wing our way inland; for our hearts ache to
see again our own country and our kindred,
and the faces of Lir our father, and Bove Derg
the king, and all whom we love. Great shall
be the joy at Shee Finnaha when they behold
us once more; but not more joyous shall their
delight be than it will be for us to see the
smoke rising from the fires of our people, and
to see the greatness and beauty of Shee Finnaha.”</p>

<p>They could not sleep that night for eagerness.
At dawn they rose on white wings,
circling through the wide blue spaces of the
air. When the yellow stream of the sun
poured westward out of the mountain-ridges
of Achill, they chanted a farewell song, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
then stretched their wide pinions and flew
homeward with beating hearts.</p>

<p>Sweet it was to see below them the green
grass instead of the cold, running wave; and
the hollows of the meadows, how much dearer
were they than the troughs of the drowning
billows!</p>

<p>When they came to the great hill above
Shee Finnaha, their wings were seized with so
great a trembling that scarcely could they reach
into view of Lir’s high shining house.</p>

<p>Descending, therefore, they alit on a rock
and rested awhile. A deep sadness oppressed
Fionula. There was so great a silence on
every rock, on every tree. Moreover, she had
seen a stag stand staring inland with idle eyes,
and had seen the hill-fox and the wolf prowling
in the glen where as a child she had often
played.</p>

<p>“What is the fear that is in your eyes,
Fionula?” asked one of her brothers with
sudden dread.</p>

<p>“Alas! Aed, if Lir and the Dedannans were
still here, would a stag stand staring inland,
where Shee Finnaha is, with heedless eyes and
no hoof lifted, and nostrils idly sniffing the
unfrequented wind?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>“Of a surety no, Fionula.”</p>

<p>“Yet that have I seen, Aed. And if in
Shee Finnaha still dwelled our Dedannan folk,
would the hill-fox and the wolf prowl in the
Glen of the White Water, there where we
were wont to play and bathe, we and all the
little children?”</p>

<p>“Of a surety no, Fionula.”</p>

<p>“Yet that have I seen, O Aed and Fiachra
and Conn. Come! we are rested now. Let
us hasten homeward to Shee Finnaha, that we
have longed for all these years, and to our
father Lir, who awaiteth us.”</p>

<p>Onward they flew.</p>

<p>But just as they soared over the shoulder of
Knoc-na-Shee, Fionula uttered a piercing cry.</p>

<p>There indeed was the valley where Lir long,
long ago had made his home. But now there
was not a single wreath of smoke rising to the
sky, not a single cow lowed in the pastures,
neither man nor woman nor child moved to
and fro. Nay, there were not even any houses.
All had gone. Amid the desolate place rose
the gaunt, dishevelled ruins of Lir’s great dun;
its halls empty and roofless, or tenanted only
by the rank grass and tall companies of nettles.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried Aed, “for the omen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
stag staring idly on Shee Finnaha, and for
that of the hill-fox and the wolf prowling in
the Glen of the White Water.”</p>

<p>But Fionula could speak no word, for her
heart was breaking.</p>

<p>For long they crouched silent amid the
desolation of that ruined place. Thrice three
hundred years had passed since they had
played in front of the house of Lir: beneath
yonder ruined wooden arch they had set forth
with Aeifa on that ill-fated journey.</p>

<p>The dusk came. Still the four children of
Lir crouched silent amid the ruined desolation
which was all that remained of lordly Shee
Finnaha.</p>

<p>The wolf prowled near, but turned away the
flame of his yellow eyes, for he feared those
who crouched there and had the voices of the
human kind. The bats and owls alone paid no
heed.</p>

<p>When the stars glistened in the sky, and the
moon rose, and on the night wind there was
not the lowing of a cow or the barking of a
dog, or any sound whatsoever, save from the
rustling forest and the murmuring stream,
Fionula and Aed and Fiachra and Conn fell
into a bitter sobbing and a long, mournful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
keen, that rose into the hills with plaintive
echoes.</p>

<p>When the day broke, each told the other
that they could no longer stay in Shee Finnaha.
That desolation was now to them more
bitter than the wilderness of the bleak seas of
the Moyle. While they were still speaking
thus sorrowfully, Conn descried an old man&mdash;so
old and worn that his hair hung about his
wrinkled face like thistledown, so white and
bleached was it. He carried a small harp, but
in his eyes was the look of one who saw only
far into the mind and never from the mind
outward.</p>

<p>“Who art thou, O stranger?” Conn asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at the swan that spoke to
him in human speech, and in the sweet, familiar
tongue of the Gael.</p>

<p>“I have heard strange things,” he muttered,
“and in my madness have come to learn of
the beasts. Have not the hawks and eagles
of Shee Finnaha told me bitter tidings, and has
not the hill-fox barked to me of the graves of
dead hopes, and has not the she-wolf whined
to me in the dusk of the sorrows that flit
through the woods&mdash;the old ancient sorrows of
the wise and the beautiful and the brave that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
are now no more? Why then should not a
wild swan speak? Have I forgotten that,
ages ago, the children of Lir were changed
into swans, and that they spoke with the
human tongue, and sang songs so passing
sweet that life and death became as the selfsame
dream? Ah! that dream of dreams:
fragrant it was as the breath of Moy Mell, the
honey-sweet plain of Heaven; restful as the
sound of the waves beating on the shores of
Tir-fa-Tonn, where the dead dwell in youth
and joy; strange and wild as the noise of invisible
wings over the blessed isle that is Hy
Brásil in the west.”</p>

<p>Conn spake again:</p>

<p>“Art thou a Dedannan, old man?”</p>

<p>“A Dedannan I am, O Swan, that speakest
with the tongue of man; yea, a Dedannan I
am, if a sere and fallen leaf can be called a
child of the green tree. Say, rather, a Dedannan
I was.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou know aught of Bove Derg, the
King of the Dedannans, or of Lir, the lord
of Shee Finnaha?”</p>

<p>The stranger sighed, and by the veiling of
his eyes Conn knew that the old harper was
with the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay,” he muttered at last, “but who can
note the passage of the years when one is old
and broken and sick unto death? A hundred
years have trodden the red leaves again, or it
may be thrice a hundred, since I chanted the
death-song of Bove Derg, the King of the
Dedannans; since I looked on the white face
of Lir, as he lay grey and ashy among the
ashy-grey thistles.”</p>

<p>Conn uttered a cry of sorrow, and a bitter
keen of lament came from his two brothers and
from Fionula.</p>

<p>“Then these also speak,” muttered the old
harper: “almost can I persuade myself that
I look on the wild swans that are the four
children of Lir&mdash;Fionula and Aed and Fiachra
and Conn. Ages ago I thought they had
lapsed in death. All are gone now, save only
Aeifa, who is a demon of the air, and wails
among the hills and in desolate places.”</p>

<p>All this time Fionula had been looking
earnestly at the old man. Now she spoke.</p>

<p>“Tell me, art thou not Irbir the Harper?”</p>

<p>“It is Irbir the Harper I am, the chief
harper of Bove Derg, that was King of the
Dedannans before the Fairy Host faded away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
from the meadows and pastures of Erin.
And if indeed ye be the children of Lir, know
I am that Irbir who sang the birth-song at
the birthing of ye, Fionula and Aed, and at the
birthing of ye, Fiachra and Conn.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the old harper embraced the
four swans, tears running down his face the
while.</p>

<p>While he was yet embracing them, his
wildered mind began to wander, and he talked
idly of vain things.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they learned from him that
more than a hundred years back, and maybe
thrice a hundred, the Tuatha-De-Danann had
fought a last great battle with the Milesians
and had been utterly defeated. They were
now a dispersed and hidden people, some
deathless, others living to the thousand and
one years of the old-world folk, and some with
a new and terrible mortality upon them. As
for Bove Derg and all the Fairy Host, the
wild thistle waved over their nameless graves.
Lir lay beneath the grass outside his great dun
of Shee Finnaha. His last words had been:
“I hear the beating of wings. O wild swans,
I hear the beating of thy wings.”</p>

<p>Thereafter Irbir the Harper moved aimlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
away, and with him passed the shadow
of the greatness that was gone.</p>

<p>The children of Lir now spoke wearily
among themselves of what they should do.
At the last they decided to go back to the
Isle of Glora, and there await the fulfilment
of their doom.</p>

<p>One more night they spent at Shee Finnaha,
mourning over the grey sorrow of Lir, and
over the desolation of that noble place, and
over the ruin of the Dedannan folk. So wild
and mournful was their singing that night
that the beasts of the forest congregated round
the ruined dun, and from the crags of the
hills thronged the cliff-hawks and the eagles.
In the heart of the woods Irbir, the old harper,
died, dreaming that he was in Tir-nan-Og,
the Land of Youth, and was listening again
to the voices of Love.</p>

<p>On the morrow the children of Lir flew
sorrowfully away from Shee Finnaha and
returned to Innis Glora. They alit at a small
lake in the heart of that isle, and there began
once more to sing their slow, sweet, fairy
music.</p>

<p>So wonderful was their singing, with all its
added pain and the mystery of years, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
birds of all the regions round were wont to
collect daily, and gather in flocks round about
the singing swans. Thus it was that the little
lake came to be called the Lake of the Bird
Flocks.</p>

<p>At sunrise these innumerable birds would
disperse far and wide; some seaward, some
inland, some northward to Achill, some as far
south as the three rocks known as Donn’s
Sea-Rest, some to Inniskea&mdash;to this day called
the Isle of the Lonely Crane, for there dwells,
and has dwelled since the beginning of the
world, and shall dwell till the day of flame, a
solitary brooding crane. But at night every
bird returned to Innis Glora, to hear the slow,
sweet, fairy music of the children of Lir.</p>

<p>In this way the years went past.</p>

<p>On a day of the days Fionula called her
brothers to listen to her, because of a dream
that she had dreamed.</p>

<p>“The Taillkenn<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> has come at last,” she said.
“I saw a strange light in the East at midnight.
A star rose out of it, and travelled through
the gulfs of the sky, and rested over Erin,
and sank slowly over this our dear land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Then I heard a smoke of voices rising to the
stars, and thence, too, came a chiming sweeter
than any chants we have sung in all these
thrice three hundred years.”</p>

<p>On the eve of that day a man came forth
from the mainland in a coracle. He came
to Innis Glora, and alighted there, and kneeled
in a strange fashion, and supplicated some
god.</p>

<p>It was St. Kemoc.</p>

<p>After nightfall the wild swans were silent,
for all were heavy with the strangeness of this
man, who was not like unto any Dedannan
or even a Milesian, and who prayed on his
knees, and supplicated a god set beyond the
stars.</p>

<p>In the grey dawn they awoke, trembling.
Trembling still, they started and ran bewilderedly
to and fro, for strange and dreadful to
them was the sound that they heard. It was
but a little sound, and faint and afar; but
it was the chiming of a bell, and in all the
thrice three hundred years and more they had
lived they had heard nought like it. The
bell was the matin-bell of St. Kemoc, but they
knew it not, nor what it meant. Aed and
Fiachra and Conn ran wildly and far, but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
last when the bell ceased, they returned to
Fionula.</p>

<p>“Do you know what this sound is, this
faint, fearful sound that has terrified us, dear
brothers?”</p>

<p>“No, we have heard the faint, fearful voice,
but know not what it is. Is it the voice of the
strange man who has come among us, and is he
a god?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Fionula, with grave joy,
“but it is the voice of the Christians’ bell.
Soon we shall be free of our spell; soon we
shall have peace. It is the bell we have
dreamed of for so many years.”</p>

<p>All were glad at that. Kemoc had again
begun to ring his matin-bell, and the four
swans crouched low, listening to its strange
music. When it ceased, Fionula spoke:</p>

<p>“Let us now sing our music.”</p>

<p>Therewith they sang their slow, sweet, fairy
music.</p>

<p>Kemoc rose in his place, amazed with great
wonder. At first he thought it was the voices
of the angels singing in Paradise. Then suddenly
it was revealed to him that it was the slow,
sweet, fairy music of the children of Lir, whereat
he rejoiced exceedingly, for he had fared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
westward in the hope to find and save Fionula
and Aed and Fiachra and Conn, of whom he
had heard soon after he came to Erin with
tidings of Christ and the Christian faith.</p>

<p>So when his prayers were done, and sunrise
put a shine of gold upon the sea, Kemoc rose
and went to the lake, and hailed the four white
swans. And when they answered and told
him who they were, he gave thanks to God.</p>

<p>“Come now to land,” he added, “and
sojourn with me, for it is in this place that ye
are destined to be freed from your enchantment.”</p>

<p>Filled with a great joy on hearing the words
of the Christian saint, they came ashore,
and went with him to where he had builded
his cell against the forefront of a cave.</p>

<p>Three days later a skilled craftsman for
whom he had sent came to Innis Glora, and
wrought two slender shining chains of silver.
These St. Kemoc put upon Fionula and Aed
and upon Fiachra and Conn, to show that they
were now bondagers to Christ, for all that they
were still swans and under the doom of the
spell of Aeifa.</p>

<p>Thereafter the time passed with joy and
peace. Kemoc taught them the holy faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
came to love them with his whole heart. As
for the children of Lir they were glad with
so great a gladness that they remembered no
more their long misery, and even loved better
to hear the hymns and litanies of St. Kemoc
than the lifesweet war-chants and love-songs
they had heard in their childhood from Irbir
and other bards and minstrels.</p>

<p>But at that time<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> there was a queen in Erin
who above all other things desired the glory of
having these marvellous singing swans as her
own. In the olden days men and women
were wont to hold the decrees of the gods and
of fate in reverence; and more thought was
taken of the inner meanings of dreams, marvels,
and the strange vicissitudes of life. Has not a
wise poet declared that the smaller the soul the
greater the tyranny? This queen was Decca,
daughter of Finghin, king of Munster, and
wife of Lairgnen, the king of Connaught.</p>

<p>It was of these two that Aeifa, long, long
ago, had spoken prophetically, but none remembered
this save only Fionula, in whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
mind dreams and memories floated as water-blooms
on a mountain lake&mdash;the blooms that
float and sink and rise as though a breath
sustained or swayed them, the breath out of
still, pellucid depths.</p>

<p>At last the desire of Decca overmastered
her. She begged Lairgnen to fare westward
to Kemoc, and obtain the swans from the saint
and bring them to her. But this the king
feared to do, nor held it a kingly act. Then
Decca gave way to her anger, and left the
great house of the king and vowed that she
would not sleep there another night till Lairgnen
brought her the singing swans.</p>

<p>So the woman fled southward into Munster,
her father’s realm.</p>

<p>Lairgnen the Connaught king loved his wife
to weakness. He was the slave of her dark
eyes and her smiling lips and her selfish heart
and her poor will: so he came to evil then,
and later. For according as a man’s love is,
and as he loves to strength, so shall his life
be abased or uplifted.</p>

<p>So Lairgnen sent messengers after Decca,
and sought her in the south. Thus was the
prophecy fulfilled.</p>

<p>The woman returned, but put a bond upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the king. He was weak, and she made a
sport of him as women do who are loved to
weakness and not to strength: as with men
also, when women love them ignobly, and not
as high mate with high mate.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Lairgnen gave the
word to St. Kemoc that he desired the four
swans to be sent to him at his royal house
in Connaught. Kemoc, however, refused. He
served the King of kings, not the king of Connaught.</p>

<p>Full of wrath, Lairgnen set out for the
western coast, and at last reached Innis Glora.
When he asked Kemoc if he had indeed refused
to give up the swans at his command,
and was told that this was so, he swore the
old pagan oath by the sun and the moon and
the wind, and vowed that he would not leave
that place without them.</p>

<p>“Doom must be fulfilled, O king,” said
Kemoc, “but woe unto that man by whom
the evil of a day of the days is wrought.”</p>

<p>Lairgnen laughed, and followed the saint
into the little chapel where the four swans stood
before the altar, singing a sweet wonderful
song that was a hymn of peace and joy. Seizing
the silver chain of Fionula and Aed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
one hand, and that of Fiachra and Conn in
the other, he forced them to follow him.</p>

<p>“Do not do this thing, Lairgnen, son of
Colman,” said St. Kemoc.</p>

<p>“And for why not?” asked the king, smiling
grimly, as he neared the door of the wattle-church.
“Am I not the king, and can I not
do as I will in mine own lands?”</p>

<p>“There is another King. If thou doest a
wrong against Him, thou shalt have neither
the desire of thine heart nor yet go free of
the penalty of lifelong sorrow and a bitter
end.”</p>

<p>For a moment Lairgnen quailed. The
angry voice of a cleric was a perilous omen
in those days. Then he strode forward, dragging
after him the four swans.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild, strange cry resounded over
the church. All stood silent, appalled. To
Fionula only was it revealed that it was neither
the screaming of the wind, nor the thin shrewd
wail of the sea, nor the savage cry of a sea-mew&mdash;but
that it was the voice of Aeifa, that lost
forlorn demon of the air for whom there might
be no rest now till the day of the flame of
which St. Kemoc spoke.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Lairgnen, with a great effort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>But when he strove with the chains, lo! a
strange thing happened. These fell apart, and
at the same moment the great wings of the
swans contracted, and the white feathers that
were the beauty of their bodies shrivelled. A
mist of blown feathers was about them: and
when Lairgnen and Kemoc looked through
this as it settled upon the ground like dust,
they beheld a wonderful and a terrible thing.</p>

<p>For as the feathers fell away from the children
of Lir, Fionula and her brothers once
more regained their human shape. But now
they were no longer fair and sweet and young,
as they were when Aeifa put her enchantment
upon them. They stood there, worn with
intolerable age. Grey and ashy were their
bodies, and long and sere and white their thin,
blanched hair: and they were tremulous as
reeds, and their wan hands were as the shaking
wan leaves of the poplar when autumn is
dead.</p>

<p>The children of Lir looked one upon the
other with dim, forlorn eyes. It was a bitter
thing to live so many ages only to find that
their own kith and kin were as dust, and that
their habitation was a wilderness, and that their
very race had passed away: to see each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
in human form again, but Fionula an aged
ancient woman, grey as old hanging moss and
wrinkled as the wave-rippled sand, and tall
Aed and swift Fiachra and laughing Conn as
three feeble old men, wavering as their own
shadows.</p>

<p>When Lairgnen saw this he was overcome
with dread. He uttered a strange cry, and,
averting his face, fled from the little chapel,
nor looked back once upon Innis Glora; and
feared the following flight of his own shadow
till once more he reached his great house in
Connaught, over which he heard a demon of
the air wailing and laughing, and knew that
it was Aeifa, and that the terror of this banshee
would be with him and his for ever.</p>

<p>As he fled, he heard the bitter execrations
of St. Kemoc, but these he heeded less than
the thin, inarticulate murmur of the voices
of the children of Lir, like the hum of gnats
in a well.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Kemoc himself was able to
hear the whisper of Fionula. So one may
hear the faint rustle of leaves in the heart of
a forest where there is no wind.</p>

<p>“Be swift, holy one, and give us baptism,
here before the altar. We have but a brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
while wherein to draw breath. Great is thy
sorrow at this parting, but not more great than
is ours. Nevertheless the end is always in the
beginning, and we are but the dry thistledown
of the young sprays of green. For thee, too,
O Kemoc, the vial of silence shall be broken,
but not until thy hair is like the foam of the
sea, and thine eyes dim as the light beneath
a wave.”</p>

<p>Thereupon St. Kemoc led them slowly towards
the altar, and bade farewell to each, for
he saw that the shadow of death had covered
them from the soles of the feet to the chin
of the head, and was rising to the eyes.</p>

<p>Once more Fionula spoke.</p>

<p>“Farewell, dear brothers,” she said. “We
are so old that we have forgotten age. Very
weary should we be were it not for sweet
death. We go far hence, and it may well be
that we visit Hy Brásil before we see the
shining of the gates of Paradise. There we
shall greet our father Lir, and he shall come
with us. And if he come not, we shall abide
with him, for love is stronger than death.”</p>

<p>“Even so,” whispered Aed and Fiachra and
Conn.</p>

<p>“And to thee, Kemoc, thou holy one,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
murmured, “I have this thing for the saying.
We are of our people, and would fain be in
the darkness as our ancient forgotten dead
before us. It is not fitting that we lie in the
earth who are of the old race, and have the
blood of kings, and have lived in no dishonour,
and die as we have lived.”</p>

<p>“Speak, Fionula.”</p>

<p>“When we fail utterly and perish, as we
shall do within this hour that is upon us, O
Kemoc, remember that as in life I so often
sheltered my brothers against my breast and
sides when we were swans, we must not be
apart in death. Therefore bury us on this
spot and in one grave.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> And in that grave
let Conn stand near me at my right side, and
Fiachra at my left, and let Aed my twin-brother
be before my face.”</p>

<p>With that she sighed. So sighs a wan, drifting
leaf wind-slidden over sere grass.</p>

<p>Then Kemoc baptized Fionula and Aed and
Fiachra and Conn: and when he had given
them eternity and the company of saints, they
died. They did not fall, but wavered as dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
reeds, and were suddenly at one with their
own shadows, and were no more.</p>

<p>When the saint rose from his knees, he put
the tears from his face and stared into the
deeps of heaven. Then he had the joy of a
glad vision. Overhead he beheld four children
with light silver-shining wings, their faces
radiant: yet knew not whether they were little
ones or were youthful with new life, for the
glory dazzled him. A moment, as the foam-bells
on a falling wave, they were there: then
they vanished, and passed westward, and were
in Hy Brásil with Lir and their own people
even while Kemoc bent lamenting over the
frail ancient bodies that had been the children
of Lir.</p>

<p>So in that place a grave was digged, and
Fionula was placed standing therein: and by
her right side, Conn; and by her left, Fiachra;
and before her face, Aed. Over this grave
Kemoc raised a mound, and put a great stone
upon it. Then he made a lament over the
dead.</p>

<p>When all the people were gone, there remained
only Kemoc, and a young poet and
cleric named Ebric the son of Ebric, the son
of Ebric of Irros Domnann. And when St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Kemoc went to his cell, and knew the dark
hour, because of his sorrow, Ebric stood by
the great stone at the mound and graved in
Ogham the names of Fionula and Aed and
Fiachra and Conn.</p>

<p>The salt grasses wave out of the dust, the
dust of the powder of that stone which Ebric
graved with cunning hand: but out of the
hearts of men who shall take the sorrowful
tale of the Children of Lir, or against it shall
prevail what frost of age, what breath of
time?</p>

<p>The stone perisheth, but the winged word
on the breath of the lips endureth for ever.</p>

<h2 class="newpage nobreakin"><a name="The_Fate_of" id="The_Fate_of"></a>The Fate of<br />
the Sons of Turenn</h2>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">I will</span> tell you now the old heroic saga of
the Fate of the Sons of Turenn: how they
paid the great eric laid upon them by Lu the
Long-Handed, called the Ildanna because of
his great wisdom in all magic craft and Dedannan
lore; and how at the last their dauntless
bravery was as sand before the wind, as
mist before the sun, as dew upon the grass.</p>

<p>It is one of the most ancient of tales. Brian,
Ur, and Urba, the sons of Turenn, did their
great wrong upon Kian, the father of Lu of
the Long Hand, and paid their unheard-of and
heroic eric, when Bove Derg, the last king of
the Dedannans, was still a youth&mdash;and that was
long before the Children of Lir were changed
into four white swans.</p>

<p>No Milesian had been seen in Erin in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
days. Nevertheless the power of the
Dedannans was already broken, though they
were still foremost in green Banba, as the
bards loved to call Erin, after a great queen
who had reigned there, when the Fairy Host
was supreme: for the fierce Fomorian pirates
of the north had descended upon them again
and again like a devastating plague, and at last
their High King, the King of Lochlin, Balor
of the Evil Eye, had subdued them into bondage.</p>

<p>Year by year, and that for the fourth part
of a year, Balor sent his emissaries to collect
tribute. The men were of the greatest and
fiercest of the black Fomorians, so called because
they were black-haired and black-bearded,
with fells as coarse and thick as those of
wild boars. These men were dreaded by the
Dedannans, for they appeared to be beyond
all reach of magic spells, and to have more
terrible arms and an invincible power in warfare.</p>

<p>At that time Nuadh of the Silver Hand was
High King of Erin. He was the most prudent
of all the Dedannan kings, but there were many
of the wisest druids and bards even in his own
day who lamented that he was over-prudent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and that it would be wiser to risk all in order
to regain honour and freedom than to lose all
for the sake of an inglorious peace. Nevertheless,
so great was the love of life among the
people at large, and so keen was their desire
to be left at peace by the Fomorians, that
Nuadh of the Silver Hand put aside his kinglihood,
and agreed to pay both tribute and
homage.</p>

<p>The yearly tax laid by Balor of the Evil
Eye upon Nuadh of the Silver Hand and all
the Dedannan folk, was this: a tax separately
upon querns, kneading-troughs, and
baking-flags, the three things which every
Dedannan had to use. Besides this, there was
a tax of one gold ounce for every man and
woman of the Tuatha-De-Danann. Every year
the people had to assemble at the Hill of Tara,
where the High King had his palace, and there
submit their tribute with many obeisances to
the dark, scowling emissaries of Balor of the
Evil Eye.</p>

<p>In one year of the years this happened as
before. But after Nuadh of the Silver Hand
and all his nobles and druids and all the
Dedannans had made humble obeisance before
the Fomorians, and while the tribute was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
being put together, a strange sight was descried.</p>

<p>Coming from the east was a company of
lordly men, splendidly arrayed in white with
gleaming helmets and shields, and riding tall
white horses. These were headed by a youthful
champion of so great a stature and so
warlike a mien, that all men knew he could be
none other than Lu the Long-Handed, son
of Kian the Noble. All the northlands and
eastlands of Erin were aware of the rumour of
his great valour and worth, and there was at
that day no champion so feared between the
two seas.</p>

<p>Lu, son of Kian, was also of the Dedannans,
but he was of the older and rarer
branch, and he and his claimed that the Fairy
Host, of which they formed the chief ornament,
rose or fell by their support. Among the
splendid company were the sons of Manannan,
son of Lir, the lord of the sea, and other
chieftains and brave knights. Yet, as they
approached, it was Lu of the Long Hand
who held all eyes. Upon his head was a
golden helmet, wherefrom gleamed two great
shining stones&mdash;the eyes of strange gods they
seemed to the people. His body was covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
with shining armour that was no other than the
famous coat of armour of Manannan, through
which no weapon might pierce; and by his
side hung the terrible sword, the “Answerer,”
which had but one answer for every one against
whom it was raised&mdash;death. The horse, too,
that Lu rode was the far-famed stallion of
Manannan, so swift that the March wind could
not overtake him, nor could water, air, or
land offer any obstacles to his progress.</p>

<p>A great shout welcomed these champions of
the Fairy Host as they drew near, but this
shout came from the assemblage outside of
Tara; and neither the king nor his lords rose
at their approach. The Fomorians scowled
and stood apart, and then scornfully resumed
their tax-gathering.</p>

<p>When they had finished their task the
Fomorians rose and together approached the
place where the king sat high among his people.</p>

<p>As they drew near, Nuadh of the Silver
Hand and all his lords rose and made humble
obeisance.</p>

<p>At this, Lu the Ildanna frowned, and when
Lu of the Long Hand frowned his company
knew that evil was like to come.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O King,” he said haughtily: “why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
do you make obeisance to these rude, ungainly
folk, and did none to us when we approached,
to us who are of the old Dedannan race?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Nuadh of the Silver Hand spake
the bitterness of truth, and how it was that in
order to save the land from devastation, and his
people from rapine and outrage, he submitted to
the Fomorian yoke. And for the same reason
he had not ventured to pay homage to Lu and
the Fairy Host, for the Fomorians would have
taken this as an insult to Balor of the Evil
Eye, and some great evil would have ensued.</p>

<p>Lu smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>“And at the worst, O Nuadh of the Silver
Hand, there is a disastrous end and death.
What then? Is not death the sure end of all
men, and is not disaster the lot of many a hero
as well as of many a slave?”</p>

<p>“That is so, Ildanna.”</p>

<p>“Then why evade that shadow, and all because
of fear of these dark pirates out of the
north. Is not honour better than safety,
and is not shame a worse death than to be
slain?”</p>

<p>“Even so, Ildanna. Nevertheless, I wish
to avoid vain bloodshed. There can be but
one end. Why should I ruin my people?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>“Ruin is not a sure thing, O King: but if it
were, better ruin than dishonour.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou speak as a lord of high birth, or
as one of the common people?”</p>

<p>“I speak as the son of Kian the Noble.”</p>

<p>“Even so; but for each noble in my kingdom
there are a thousand Dedannans of
no rank. I am their king. I speak for
them.”</p>

<p>For a time thereafter Lu sat brooding.
His silence was worse than his scornful words.
Nuadh the King saw what was in his mind,
and dreaded that he would go forth in his
wrath. Thrice he half rose as though to lay
hands upon Lu to restrain him, and thrice
he sat back uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Lu rose, and in the eyes
of all men drew slowly from its sheath his great
white sword. At sight of the “Answerer,”
there was a shiver among the Dedannans, so
great was the terrible fame of this sword, but
still more because the drawing of it there and
then by Lu of the Long Hand meant that
the flame was in his blood.</p>

<p>“Beware!” cried the king.</p>

<p>But Lu laughed a grim laugh. Then, lifting
the “Answerer” on high, and knitting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
brows into a heavy frown, he sprang in among
the Fomorians.</p>

<p>It was like the leap of lightning among wild
cattle, that. Hither and thither the “Answerer”
flashed, and at each blow a Fomorian head
whirled to the ground; yea, as a sharp prow
will divide the wave-crest from the wave, so
the great sword severed the head from the
shoulders of each Fomorian, shoring through
helmet or thick fell of hair as through water.</p>

<p>It was not till a whirlwind of swords
flashed and circled around Lu that those
about him woke from their stupor. Then
with a loud shout the sons of Manannan and
others of the Fairy Host leaped forward and
joined in the fray.</p>

<p>The Fomorians fought with fury, being
wrought to madness by the thought that they
were as chaff before these newcomers, in the
face of the whole Dedannan nation&mdash;for so
great was their scorn of the people they held
in bondage that death at their hands seemed
doubly accursed.</p>

<p>But before Lu of the Long Hand and his
Fairy Host there was no withstaying. By
tens and scores the Fomorians fell, as swaying
grain before the reaper. Everywhere, flashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
like a meteor, the white gleam of the Answerer
rose and fell, the pulse of death.</p>

<p>At last only nine of the Fomorian pirates
survived, and these clustered upon a low rising,
and fought desperately to the end. Suddenly
the tides of battle ceased, and this was because
of the voice of Lu Ildanna.</p>

<p>He looked scornfully at the remnant of the
proud Fomorians. These were now sullenly
at bay, foreseeing death only, and not unwillingly
now that the despised Dedannans
had brought them to so sore a pass.</p>

<p>“Let these dogs go!” exclaimed Lu.</p>

<p>At the bitter words, the emissaries of King
Balor of Lochlin gripped their swords anew,
and ground their teeth in impotent rage.
More they could not do, for even in their
brief breathing space they saw that they were
beset by a hedge of spears.</p>

<p>“Let these dogs go!” Lu said again.
Then, addressing them, he added:</p>

<p>“Look ye, ye carrion wolves, we spare your
lives only that ye may fare back to your dens
in the north, and tell that unkingly king, Balor
of the Evil Eye, that which we have done unto
your company. And say this also, that if he
come hither, we shall do unto him and his, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
which we have done unto these dead men who
were once your fellows.” With that the nine
Fomorians departed, scowling fiercely and
below their breath muttering imprecations and
menaces.</p>

<p>That night the beacons of joy flared out
across valley and plain, from the hill of Tara,
and great were the rejoicings throughout the
land. Only Nuadh of the Silver Hand dreamed
uneasily for that and many other nights; knowing
well that Balor of the Evil Eye would not
let pass the slight which had been put upon
him. And after all, it was but a handful of
the Fomorian host which had been slain on
the Plains of Tara. Nevertheless, the king
hoped that he might be spared the wrath
of Balor, for none of the Dedannans whom
he ruled had taken part in the fray, but only
those who were of the company of Lu of the
Long Hand.</p>

<p>Bitter, indeed, was the wrath of Balor, when
he heard what had been done to his Fomorian
emissaries.</p>

<p>“The Dedannans shall soon be but a
memory,” he exclaimed; “their kings and
nobles shall utterly perish, and of all their
race none shall survive save those who shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
be slaves for ever to my people. Their very
land, that green Eri they are so fain of, shall
be no more than an unregarded province of
Lochlin.”</p>

<p>Thereafter, Balor sent word throughout all
Lochlin, from the Cape of the Midnight Sun
to the Narrow Seas,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and bade all the peoples
who owned him king to assemble speedily for
war; and in every haven he bade the sea-galleys
to be got ready.</p>

<p>This took many weeks, and thereafter was
the slow waiting for the coming of spring.
But at last all was ready, and then Bras, the
son of Balor, led forth the mightiest host which
had ever sailed from the shores of Lochlin.</p>

<p>This vast concourse of galleys sailed northward
before favouring winds, and then westward
along the storm-swept coasts of Alba, and
at last southward again by the Hebrid Isles.
Thence, with fresh provisions and replenished
water-barrels, they sailed towards and round
the northern headlands of Eri, and like a great
flock of sea-vultures settled upon the coasts of
Connaught.</p>

<p>With laughter and fierce disdain the Fomorians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
spread far and wide, and at once began to
despoil the country, and lay waste the tilled
lands. In the ears of all rang the arrogant
parting words of Balor of the Evil Eye: “And
when at the last ye have cut off for me the head
of that man Lu, called the Ildanna, then put a
mighty cable around this troublesome Isle of
Erin, and tow it back with your ships, and lay
it alongside the north coasts of our Lochlin.”</p>

<p>But meanwhile all the realms of the Tuatha-De-Danann
were smitten with fear. None
dared await the dreaded Fomorians, and
everywhere were flying hordes of men and
women and children, chariots, horses, and
cattle.</p>

<p>The king of Connaught in that day was
Bove Derg, son of the Dagda, he who afterwards
became the last Dedannan king.
Straightway he sent word to Lu Ildanna,
begging him to raise a host and succour the
men of Connaught, as otherwise not a man
would be left to stay the advance of the
Fomorians.</p>

<p>Lu of the Long Hand was sorrowful that
by his action he had brought this curse upon
the lands of Erin, yet he knew that it was
better than the old shame. By the Sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Moon and Wind he swore that he would do all
he could to raise a host, and himself give battle
to Bras and his Fomorians.</p>

<p>With all speed he hasted to Dunree, and was
glad indeed when he saw the Hill of Tara rise
from the plain. For of a surety he held that
Nuadh of the Silver Hand would join with the
princes of Erin and fight the invader.</p>

<p>That surety was in vain. Nuadh refused to
go into battle.</p>

<p>“When Bras leads his Fomorians towards
the Hill of Tara,” he said, “that will be time
for me to raise the banner against him.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Nuadh of the Silver Hand, art thou
not High King?” exclaimed Lu.</p>

<p>“Even so, Ildanna.”</p>

<p>“And is not thy first duty to lead the princes
of Erin against the invader? If we are all as
one, we can laugh at Balor of the Evil Eye
and all the host he sends against us. If we are
divided we shall surely fall.”</p>

<p>But for all the pleadings of Lu Ildanna,
Nuadh refused to take the field. He had one
answer to all pleas.</p>

<p>“Bras and his Fomorian host do no more
than lay waste the lands of Connaught. Let
then the king of Connaught see to his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
I have sent friendly messages to Balor, and in
order to keep the peace have offered alliance
and even to pay tribute again. But till war is
declared against me I will do nothing.”</p>

<p>Furious against Nuadh of the Silver Hand,
Lu Ildanna rode away.</p>

<p>“Dust upon thy home,” he muttered, “were
it not for the ruin upon all Erin. Nevertheless,
I have but one thing to do.”</p>

<p>Lu had not ridden far, when his heart rejoiced
because of three strong warriors he saw
approaching.</p>

<p>These were his father, Kian, and the two
brothers of his father, Ald and Art. In that
day the seven fairest champions in the northlands
of Erin were Lu himself, Kian and his
two brothers, and Brian, Ur, and Urba, the
sons of Turenn. Each of these was a host in
himself, both because of his own valour and for
the great influence that each had upon the
clansmen of the north.</p>

<p>In a brief while Lu told all, and begged
the aid of these three chiefs for Bove Derg,
and not for Bove Derg only, but for the honour
and safety of Erin.</p>

<p>Kian and Ald and Art were wroth with the
high king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>“The first duty of a king is kinglihood,” said
Kian.</p>

<p>“And without deathless courage a king is
dead,” said Ald.</p>

<p>“And without sleepless eyes a king is a
sluggard,” said Art.</p>

<p>“A king should be to all men what each
man would fain be to himself,” said Lu.
“My father Kian says well: the first duty of
a king is kinglihood. But since Nuadh of the
Silver Hand is fain to rest at ease in his dun,
under the safe shadow of Tara, so let him rest.
We are men, and must act.”</p>

<p>Therewith all took counsel, and while Lu
rode westward, to raise all whom he could to
succour the men of Connaught, Ald and Art
rode southward.</p>

<p>“I shall go north,” said Kian.</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Lu, knowing that it
would be best for his father to go eastward.</p>

<p>“The wind bloweth that way,” answered
Kian lightly. But truly enough none knew
that in that answer and in that riding northward,
was the beginning of the long and
dreadful tragedy of which, for generations
thereafter, the bards sang as The Fate of the
Sons of Turenn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At this point Peterkin rose from where he
kneeled beside Eilidh, and went over to Ian
Mor and took his hand and looked long at
him.</p>

<p>“These words I have heard you say again
and again, Ian&mdash;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ma tha sin an Dan</i>, if it be
Destiny&mdash;what do they mean?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, Peterkin; for to me they
mean everything.”</p>

<p>“But must Kian come to sorrow because he
followed the way of the wind?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, Peterkin. But of this
you may be sure, that no man needs to do
this or that thing because of the way of the
wind or anything else. Only, behind all
doings of men there is a wind that blows.
That is the wind of Destiny. That is what I
meant when I said that Kian, choosing lightly
to go the way of the wind, and by his own
choice, yet went the way of Fate.”</p>

<p>“And is Fate a man?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Has any one ever seen it?”</p>

<p>“No.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>Peterkin laughed below his breath.</p>

<p>“Ivor Maclean the boatman, told me that
‘an Dan’ was only a shadow before and
behind, and that none need trouble about a
shadow.”</p>

<p>“And what do <em>you</em> think, Peterkin?”</p>

<p>“I think that ‘an Dan’ is only a shadow
before and behind; and I laugh to see my
shadow, but I do not fear it. It is only a
shadow.”</p>

<p>“Peterkin is right, Ian,” said Eilidh, in a
low voice. “And do you remember what was
said long ago about wisdom coming out of the
mouths of little children?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ian answered slowly and gravely,
“Peterkin is right.”</p>

<p>But Peterkin only laughed merrily, as suddenly
he sprang up.</p>

<p>“See,” he exclaimed, “my shadow has leapt
from beside me, till now it is fading along the
wall. When I laughed it leapt away.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Well, resumed Ian Mor, Kian was not many
miles forth upon the great pastures to the
north of Tara, when he saw three lordly men
riding towards him.</p>

<p>They were still a great way off, but Kian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the Noble was noted far and wide for his
keen sight, and he knew who the mailed and
shining ones were. They were Dedannans,
but they were of a clan at bitter feud with his
own; and his heart quailed as he saw that in
that lonely place he would have to meet face
to face with Brian, Ur, and Urba, the sons
of Turenn. Far better would it have been
for him to ride forward fearlessly, and call
upon the sons of Turenn to put all enmity
aside in the face of the bitter danger to Erin
because of Bras and his Fomorians. But a
man born under a dark star must soon or late
ride into the shadow of that star.</p>

<p>So when Kian had realized that the foes of
him and his house were fast approaching, he
cast about for some way to delude the sons of
Turenn. Already they had seen the stranger,
though they had not recognised him.</p>

<p>In common with all the lords of the Dedannans,
Kian carried with him a magic wand.
With this he could at any time transform
himself into some living creature. And so it
happened that, while he was still pondering,
he caught sight of a vast herd of swine feeding
upon the thistle-pastures to the left; and
no sooner had he done so than he took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
wand and changed himself into a boar. His
horse, too, he changed; and then both, grazing
often, joined the great herd, and were soon
at one with it.</p>

<p>Kian laughed to himself at how he had
outwitted the sons of Turenn, but oversoon
did he laugh. After all he was sorrowful; for
it was not seemly for a man to change himself
into a pig, lest death or some disaster came
upon him in that guise: for, according as a
man’s doom came to him, so would he have to
bear it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three sons of Turenn rode
across the plain. Fair to see were they,
these three comely lords: Brian, the eldest
and strongest; Ur, the tallest and fairest; and
Urba the swift. They had seen Kian riding
slowly towards them, but had not thought
more than that he was an emissary from
Dunree, where Nuadh of the Silver Hand was.
When, however, they missed him suddenly,
Brian frowned and drew rein.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my brothers,” he exclaimed,
“where is he whom a brief while ago we saw
riding toward us?”</p>

<p>“He is no longer to be seen,” Urba answered.
“Yet there is no hiding-place that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
we wot of. If he were lying on the grass, we
should descry him and his horse from where
we now are.”</p>

<p>“They are not on the grass,” said Ur; “for
I could see a slim greyhound were it lying
there.”</p>

<p>Brian pondered awhile. Then he spoke
again.</p>

<p>“As ye know well, war is all about us now,
and it befits us to be wary. It is clear that
the man we saw was no friend to us, or why
has he hidden himself? But I think I know
his secret: with a magic wand he has turned
himself into a pig, and is now among that
great herd of swine that we see yonder.”</p>

<p>“Then he has escaped us, Brian?”</p>

<p>“Not so, Ur. I too have my magic wand
with me; with it I shall now turn my two
brothers into swift hounds. Ye shall then
speed in among these swine and see if ye can
root out this man, who is surely an enemy.”</p>

<p>And with that Brian took his wand, and
changed his brothers into hounds; and they
raced away with the speed of the wind, while
he rode swiftly towards a belt of forest which
skirted the plain to the rear of the herd.</p>

<p>When the baying of the hounds was heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
a panic seized upon the swine. Like a great
swaying mass of seaweed in the trough of the
waves, the herd swung to and fro; ever becoming
more and more densely packed, and
squealing and grunting in terror and bewilderment
as the two gaunt hounds sprang against
their heaving masses or dashed to and fro in
their midst.</p>

<p>At the east they were so driven in upon
themselves, that they became as one solid
mass, close-wedged. Among these dense hundreds
it seemed impossible for Ur and Urba
to find the enchanted man; but while they
were still running to and fro in their eager
quest, Brian saw a pig leap from the rear of
the herd and run swiftly towards the belt of
forest.</p>

<p>Brian put his horse upon the wind, as the
saying is; and it was a race then between the
mounted man and the enchanted boar: but
just as the first undergrowth was nigh Brian
came up with the fleeing animal, and drove his
hunting-spear in betwixt its shoulders.</p>

<p>With a terrible scream the flying boar rolled
over; then, with a wild human crying and
speech, begged for pity.</p>

<p>“Oh, son of Turenn,” it cried, “have pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
upon me! Sure it is an evil deed to slay me
thus, well knowing who I am!”</p>

<p>“I know that thy voice is the voice of a
man,” answered Brian, “but I know not who
thou art. I am Brian, eldest of the sons of
Turenn. Tell me thy name.”</p>

<p>“He who implores thy mercy, O Brian of
the Oak Shaft, is Kian, the father of thy
comrade in years and arms, Lu of the Long
Hand.”</p>

<p>By this time Ur and Urba were beside
the victor and the victim, and now resumed
their human shape. When they heard the
pleadings of Kian they interceded for him,
notwithstanding the deadly feud between the
clans of Turenn and Kian. But Brian would
not listen to their counsel, not even when
Ur pleaded that great evil might come out
of the slaying of Kian, nor when Urba urged
that this was not the day and the hour for
such a deed, when Erin needed every man to
fight against the Fomorians. And, of a truth,
that has ever been the sad way of the Gael,
who will think of the private wrong first,
than of the general weal, and so will fall as a
single tree will fall where a forest would be
steadfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>When Kian saw that his fate was come upon
him, and heard Brian swear by a sacred oath
that he would not spare him though he returned
thrice to life, or seven times changed
his form, he made one last supplication.</p>

<p>“At the least, as ye are honourable men,
save me this dishonour. Let me not die as a
pig, but as a man. I have dropped my magic
wand; therefore, O Brian, I pray of thee to
take thine, and with it restore me to mine own
form.”</p>

<p>“That shall be done,” said the chief, adding
scornfully, “for sure it is an easier thing for
me to kill a man than a pig.”</p>

<p>But no sooner was Kian a man again than
he laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh thus?” asked Ur.</p>

<p>“I laugh because I have outwitted ye at the
last, ye sons of Turenn. What is death to me
who have a dust of grey hairs over my once
black locks, or is death indeed a thing at any
time to fear overmuch? Ill as it would befit
me to die as a pig, still more ill would it be
because of that which follows death.”</p>

<p>“Speak,” said Ur, though in his heart both
he and his brothers knew what Kian was about
to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>“I have outwitted ye, as I have said; for if
as a pig I had been slain by Brian of the
Oak Shaft, then ye would have had no other
eric to pay for me than the eric of a pig, but
now ye shall have to pay the eric of a man, and
upon that the eric of a father of grown sons,
and upon that the fatherhood eric of each son,
and upon that the eric of a great lord, and upon
that the eric of the broken honour of my son
Lu of the Long Hand. And I tell ye this,
that never has there been, nor ever will be, so
great an eric as that which ye shall have to pay
for this deed of thine, so that in the years to
come men shall speak of the eric of the sons
of Turenn as the most difficult and the worst
that was ever paid in Erin.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said Brian sullenly, “but we
shall slay thee here, in this waste place, and
none shall know when death came to thee, or
where thou liest, and for all that thy son Lu
is Lu the Ildanna, he shall seek in vain to
know where the worms make merry upon
thee.”</p>

<p>“In the shadow of death I see clearly, and I
see that death will not put his silence upon
me till Lu has learned the evil deed that has
been done.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>“Spare him,” urged Urba, “for of a surety
he is already sore wounded, and he did no
more than seek to escape us. It would be well,
Brian, not to have this man’s blood upon us.”</p>

<p>“Spare him,” pleaded Ur, “for innocent
blood is an ill thing to spill. This man did not
come upon us with lifted spear or sword, but,
seeing that we were three and he one only,
sought to escape. It is not a knightly deed to
take the life of a stricken man, and of one who
asks for mercy.”</p>

<p>“We will slay him,” said Brian sullenly.</p>

<p>“Remember this,” pleaded Ur, “that if we
slay him, Urba and I must pay the penalty
along with thee, and that it is a hard thing
upon us who would fain spare this man.”</p>

<p>Brian laughed.</p>

<p>“If ye and Urba fear the eric, ye may go
hence at once. I will do my own slaying.
But ye forget that the sons of Turenn are
under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> to have no quarrel that is not the
quarrel of each, and to fight no fight wherein
each doth not front it in the same hour and
place.”</p>

<p>“We do not forget,” answered Ur and
Urba; and each added: “Do as thou wilt,
Brian, our elder brother.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>So Brian turned to where Kian lay upon the
stony thistle-strewn grass.</p>

<p>“Hast thou aught more to say?”</p>

<p>“This only, that no eric ever paid shall be
counted as near unto that which ye shall have
to pay, and that the weapons wherewith ye
slay me shall cry out to Lu my son, and tell
him what ye three have done unto me.”</p>

<p>Again Brian laughed.</p>

<p>“Thou who fled before us as a pig shalt die
as a trapped beast. We shall not give thee
the honour of death by the clean sword or the
deft spear.”</p>

<p>With that he stooped and raised on high a
huge angular slab of stone, grey below, and
mossed and lichened above, and, swaying with
the weight, hurled it down upon the head of
Kian. Then Ur and Urba lifted other great
stones, and did likewise, because of their bond.
And this was how death came to Kian the
Noble.</p>

<p>When the old chief lay still and white at last,
the three sons of Turenn made haste to hide
his body from sight; so they dug a great hole
in the sandy grass, and buried the slain
man.</p>

<p>There was a strange trembling in the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
that day, a trembling felt throughout Erin from
sea to sea, and men marvelled and feared.</p>

<p>But none so much marvelled as Brian and
Ur and Urba, for when they had buried the
bruised body of Kian they saw with horror that
the shaking earth threw it back again. Nevertheless,
once more they buried it, and deeper,
and put heavy stones upon the trodden sods.
Then, to their still greater horror and amaze,
the earth again trembled and again threw back
the murdered dead.</p>

<p>At that Ur and Urba wished to ride away
at once from the accursed place, but Brian
would not.</p>

<p>“Fate is made by men, as well as that Fate
rules men,” he said. “I shall not rest content
till the earth holds at last the body of Kian, son
of Kian the White.”</p>

<p>Yet it was not until the seventh time that
the earth trembled no more, and held within it,
beneath a cairn of boulders, the slain body of
Kian the Noble.</p>

<p>Thereafter the three sons of Turenn rode
swiftly away, and that night were among the
host which had been assembled by Lu of the
Long Hand.</p>

<p>On the morrow, on the vast plains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Moytura, the great and terrible Battle of the
Kites was fought. It was so called because
after a day of dreadful slaughter the kites and
hawks assembled in multitudes, and were
satiated with the feast of the dead. In that
battle the fiercest strife was on the part of four
heroes: Lu the Ildanna, and the three sons
of Turenn. For hours the swaying and whirling
of spears, the rush of javelins, the flashing
of swords, the trampling of horses and crash of
war-chariots, made the plain of Moytura a place
of savage din and fury. For long it seemed as
though the great might and numbers of the
Fomorians would give the day to Bras, son
of Balor of the Evil Eye; but so great was
the prowess of the Dedannan host, that
the Fomorians were mowed down as ripe
grain.</p>

<p>In the wane of the afternoon, Bras and Lu
met at last. The tides of war ceased, for all
men wished to see the battle-meeting of these
two champions.</p>

<p>But already Bras had seen that the day had
gone against the glory of Lochlin, and he knew
that an hour hence his great army would be
utterly routed, and that all who did not
straightway escape to the shores of Connaught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and gain the Fomorian galleys would be
tracked and cut down like flying wolves.</p>

<p>So he lowered his great spear, and threw his
shield upon the ground, and thereafter asked
Lu to stay the tides of battle, and agreed that
the day should be accounted as a final victory
to the men of Erin. And the son of the king
of Lochlin further agreed, that if Lu and the
leaders of the Dedannans would do this, he
would give a solemn bond to withdraw all the
Fomorians from Erin, to cancel for ever the
bond put upon the Tuatha-De-Danann by
Balor of the Evil Eye, and never to return
again in enmity, neither he nor any Fomorian
of the north nor southlander of lower Lochlin.</p>

<p>And thus it was that the great battle of
Moytura, the Battle of the Kites, came to an
end. A year thereafter the grass was not yet
green, and the plain was covered with the
white bones of the innumerous dead.</p>

<p>When all was over, and Bras and his defeated
army were hasting towards the distant
Connaught shores, Lu threw from him his
blood-stained armour and the weapons he was
almost too weary to bear. All day he had
fought, as only the mightiest heroes fight, and
many strong and valorous men had marvelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
at his dauntless courage and at the prowess
that failed not for one moment.</p>

<p>Glad was Lu of the Long Hand to see
Ald and Art, but when he asked how his
father had fared in the battle, and heard
that he had not been there, and had been
seen of no man that day, he knew that
Kian the Noble was no longer alive.</p>

<p>“For,” he said, “if my father were alive
he would have been with me this day, or, if
peradventure that were not possible, would
have sent me a sign. Howsoever this may
be, something within me tells that my father
is no longer among the living. And now,
ye who hear me, listen, for by the Sun and
the Moon and the Wind I swear that I shall
not slake this bitter thirst of mine, nor rest
this over-weary head, until I have found
how and where and when an evil fate came
upon my father, whom I loved as I have
loved and love none other.”</p>

<p>That night Lu Ildanna, with a hundred
chosen men, rode swiftly to Tara, but there
found no word of Kian.</p>

<p>On the morrow he set forth at dawn, alone;
for in a dream it had come to him that his
father lay moaning beneath the thistle-strewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
grass on the stony plain of Moy Murhenna.
And there, in truth, Lu came upon the
end of his quest; for as he rode slowly and
sadly across the plain, whereon he could not
discern a living being save a vast herd of
swine, he heard, as one may hear in a shell,
a plaintive sighing.</p>

<p>“What is that sighing?” he cried. “Is it
the death-sigh of thee, Kian my father?”</p>

<p>There was no answer save the strange
sighing, that was not of the wind or any
moving thing, but seemed now to come from
above, now from around, now from beneath.
But at the third asking, a voice answered,
thin and feeble:</p>

<p>“It is the death-sighing of me, Kian thy
father, O Lu my son.”</p>

<p>“And who put death upon thee, thou who
liest there in the darkness of the shadow of
death?”</p>

<p>“The three sons of Turenn slew me here
in this waste place. And because that they
slew me in no fair strife, and because that
they finished their slaying by crushing me
with great stones till there was not left of
me one bone alive, I cry to thee, O Lu my
son, whom men now call Lu the Ildanna, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of thy craft and wisdom, to see that
a greater eric be exacted for me than has
ever yet been exacted in Erin for any slain
man. And in the end see that thou sparest
not, for otherwise there shall be a greater
bloodshed still; and ill it befits us, who are
noble, that we should bring a tide of blood
over Erin, for no worthier cause than the
wiping out of that which lies between the clan
of Kian and the clan of Turenn.”</p>

<p>“As thou sayest, O Kian my father, so
shall it be, and even unto the end. And
this I swear by the Sun and by the Moon and
by the Wind.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lu showed no grief till he
saw his father’s bruised body before him,
and then he bewailed bitterly that he had
not been nigh when the sons of Turenn drove
Kian the Noble to his fate; and bitterly he
lamented that one of the noble Dedannan
race should be slain by Dedannans; and
bitterly he swore that an eric should be
exacted such as never before had been
heard of in Erin, and that in the end, even
were it fulfilled, he should not spare, because
of what Kian had foreseen.</p>

<p>At noon Lu returned from Tara, whither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
he had gone after he had viewed the speechless
dead body of his father, with ten chosen
men whom he had bound to silence.</p>

<p>So once more Kian the Noble was placed
in his grave, but now standing, as befits a
hero. And above the grave they raised a
cairn, and midway in this cairn was a great
slab of smooth stone, whereon Lu Ildanna
graved in Ogam the name and ancestry and
great fame of Kian, son of Kian, son of Kian
the Thunder-Smith.</p>

<p>But when that night Lu entered Tara
again, the whole of the king’s town was lit
with torches, and resounded with joyous
shouts and cries because of the great victory
of the Dedannans over the Fomorians; nor
was any name so often named as that of Lu
Lamfada, Lu the Long-Handed.</p>

<p>When Lu entered the palace of the king,
he was received with a mighty shout of welcome,
and Nuadh of the Silver Hand himself
came to greet him, with fair loving words of
praise and gratitude. Right glad was the
king to see Lu come to him thus, for he
had feared that the Ildanna bore him a bitter
grudge because of his having refused his
aid to drive forth Bras and his Fomorians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Therefore it was that he paid honour to
Lu Ildanna above all other men, and led
him to a seat at his right hand, placing him
above the whole assemblage of princes and
great lords.</p>

<p>But Lu neither smiled nor made any sign
of pleasure. His eyes wandered round the
concourse of the Dedannan chivalry. Suddenly
his gaze became intent and fixed, for
upon three golden-studded seats of honour he
beheld the three sons of Turenn.</p>

<p>The high king of Erin was about to
speak to his chiefs on the great matter of
rejoicing and counsel which had brought them
all together, when Lu arose. All stared in
amaze, for only some unforeseen emergency
could justify a noble speaking before the high
king had said what he had to say.</p>

<p>“O King of Erin,” said Lu slowly, and
in a low voice, yet so clear and cold and
vibrant that it was heard of every man in
that vast concourse: “O King of Erin,
order the chain of silence to be brought hither,
and let its soft, delicate music be shaken from
it, for I have that to say that must be heard
of all men, and not in their ears only but in
their hearts and in their minds.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>Therewith the Chain of Silence was brought,
and was shaken slowly and delicately by the
young druid whose charge it was. The sweet
low sound rose into the air like fragrance,
and passed through all the halls in Tara, and
filled the ears of every man, and the mind
of each, and the soul of each. There was not
a sound in all that place, not a whisper, not
a sigh.</p>

<p>In that great silence Lu moved forward till
he stood beside the king and faced the whole
assemblage.</p>

<p>“Chiefs and warriors of the Tuatha-De-Danann,
I have that to ask ye to which I
need an answer this day. Tell me this:
What would ye do unto one who wittingly,
and not in battle but shamefully, slew your
father, and he innocent, even such a man,
say, as Kian the Noble?”</p>

<p>There was no whisper of answer. All sat
there amazed, marvelling at the strange question.
But at last Nuadh the King spoke.</p>

<p>“What meaning lives in thy words,
Ildanna? For we know that thy father
Kian is not slain, for he was not in the
Great Battle.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless he is slain, and here in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
royal place my eyes behold them who slew
him.”</p>

<p>When Lu of the Long Hand had spoken
these words, every man looked from neighbour
to neighbour in amaze. But all waited
for the king to speak.</p>

<p>“What sayest thou, Nuadh of the Silver
Hand, Ardree of Erin?”</p>

<p>“I have this to say, that if a man wittingly,
and without the just cause of war, slew
my father, and he innocent, I would not
be content with exacting death, but would
rather lop him limb from limb daily till he
died.”</p>

<p>“And what say ye, chiefs and nobles of the
Dedannan race?”</p>

<p>“We say as the Ardree says,” cried one and
all, save the three who sat on golden-knobbed
seats near the high king, though these too
bowed their heads in acquiescence.</p>

<p>“And what say ye, ye sons of Turenn?”</p>

<p>At this all turned and looked upon Brian
and Ur and Urba, who sat pale and stern.
Brian answered for himself and his brothers.</p>

<p>“We say as the high king says.”</p>

<p>“Nuadh of the Silver Hand, Ardree of
Erin, and all ye chieftains and chiefs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
nobles of the Dedannan race, I call ye to
witness that this man who has spoken slew
my father, and that he and his brothers are
jointly guilty of that foul deed.”</p>

<p>For more than the furthest singing of an
arrow, there was silence. Neither the king
nor any man spoke, but all looked to the
sons of Turenn to say Yea or Nay. But Brian
and Ur and Urba sat in a frozen stillness,
and moved neither their hands nor their lips,
and stared only with unwavering eyes upon
the white accusing face of the son of the murdered
Kian.</p>

<p>Then Lu spoke again.</p>

<p>“Behold the men who slew my father.
And now, O king, I say not whether there
were good cause for this slaying: all men know
that there was a feud between the clans of
Kian and Turenn. Nor do I wish to bring
evil into this house and town of thine. Because
one man is dead, there is no need that
others must die who have nought to do with
his death. I have come in peace: I would
go in peace. But this only I say: I go not
hence till I have won from the sons of Turenn
the vow of my eric.”</p>

<p>“That is right and wise,” answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
king, “and for myself I would be well content
if, being guilty, I could evade death by paying
any eric whatsoever.”</p>

<p>At this Brian rose.</p>

<p>“Lu, son of Kian, has spoken inadvisedly,
O king. He has accused us of a crime, he
knowing nothing of when or how that deed
was done, and in what circumstances, and how
made inevitable. Nor, again, have we ever
admitted that we are guilty of this deed of
murder.”</p>

<p>“It is enough. Kian, father of Lu Ildanna,
came to his death through ye three sons
of Turenn. Whatsoever eric Lu may exact,
that eric ye shall have to pay. Otherwise
the lives that ye hold so dear, being your
own, will no longer have the shelter of this
royal place; and as no man’s hand can be
raised to aid thee, ye shall be at the mercy
of Lu of the Long Hand, and of whomsoever
he may bring against thee.”</p>

<p>For a brief while Brian talked low with his
brothers; then he turned and addressed Nuadh
the king and Lu Lamfada.</p>

<p>“We are for peace, not strife. We say not
we are guilty, but we will pay the eric that
Lu, son of Kian, may demand, save only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
that it be not against the life of Turenn our
father.”</p>

<p>“That is well said,” exclaimed Nuadh of the
Silver Hand.</p>

<p>“I accept the troth,” said Lu, “and now
call upon all here to witness that the sons of
Turenn have made a solemn pledge.”</p>

<p>There were few there who did not wonder
what the eric would be, for all knew that Lu
was a stern man, and would not rest till he had
done his utmost to make the sons of Turenn
expiate their deed.</p>

<p>Great was their amazement, therefore,
when Lu gave forth the eric that he demanded.</p>

<p>“The eric I demand is this,” he said: “that
ye bring me three apples, a certain skin, a
spear, two horses and a chariot, seven swine,
a hound, and a roasting spit. And further,
that ye shout three shouts upon a hill. Yet, if
ye will,” Lu added scornfully, “I shall remit
a portion of this eric if ye find it too heavy
for ye.”</p>

<p>“It is neither heavy nor great,” answered
Brian, “if there be no hidden evil behind.
For by the Sun and Wind I swear that I
would not count too heavy an eric, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
hundreds of thousands of apples, or thrice a
hundred skins, or many score horses and
chariots, spears and hounds, or a shouting a
hundred times upon a hundred hills.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I do not account it small,”
answered Lu gravely. “But give me now
security that ye shall fulfil this eric to the uttermost.”</p>

<p>“We give ourselves as security.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” exclaimed Lu scornfully. “I will
not have the security of thyselves.”</p>

<p>“Then I call upon Bove Derg, son of the
Dagda, and upon Nuadh of the Silver Hand,
Ardree of Erin, and upon the score I shall
name of the foremost chiefs of the Dedannan
race, to be our pledge and warranty.”</p>

<p>And after Brian had named the score, all
they, and Nuadh the king, and Bove Derg, the
son of the Dagda, gave the pledge, so that
thenceforth the sons of Turenn were under
solemn <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> to fulfil the eric, or die in the effort
to fulfil that eric, or otherwise bring dishonour
upon all these noble and great lords, each of
whom moreover would be bound to seek the
lives of Brian and Ur and Urba.</p>

<p>“And now tell us if that is all, O Lu
Ildanna, for much I misdoubt me if thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
no evil thought for us behind thy fair-seeming
words.”</p>

<p>Thereat all leaned forward and listened
eagerly, for each man knew that Lu was not
vainly called the Ildanna, for there was no one
in all Erin who had so much knowledge, or
whose craft was so greatly to be feared.
When he had uttered the eric that he demanded,
all were at first amazed. Then some
had thought that he was under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> never to
exact a great eric, but always the smallest that
he might make; but most were troubled, for
behind these slight exactions they knew that
he had arrowy intentions.</p>

<p>“Yes, ye sons of Turenn,” Lu Lamfada
began slowly, “I shall tell ye now what my
eric is. I do not think ye shall find it over
easy.”</p>

<p>Brian and Ur and Urba rose, but all the
host otherwise remained seated. The three
sons of Turenn leaned upon their spears, and
tall and goodly warriors they seemed, and
worthy of their great fame as three of the
seven chief champions of Erin.</p>

<p>“First, then, there is this. The skin I
demand of ye is one that belongs to the king
of Greece in the far eastern lands. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
skin of healing. No man need die of wounds
who has that skin; and cold water, too, it will
make into wine. I do not think ye will come
easily by that skin.</p>

<p>“Second, there is this. The spear I demand
of ye is the spear called Aradvar, the dreadful
spear of Pisarr, Prince of Persia, whose point
is for ever kept cooling in a cauldron of water,
so terrible is its fiery thirst, and that thirst for
blood. I do not think ye will find the spear
of Pisarr easy to obtain.</p>

<p>“Third, there is this. The chariot and two
horses that I demand of ye belong to Dobar,
the king of Sicily. They heed neither the
rough ways of the land nor the rough ways of
the sea, but travel equally and at the will of
him who drives. I do not think ye will find
it easy to obtain that chariot and its two
horses.</p>

<p>“Further, there is this. Far to the south
there is a great lord, Asol of the Golden
Pillars. It is he who owns the seven swine I
ask of ye. Ye may slay the seven and yet all
will remain. They know not death, though ye
may slay them and feed upon them. There is
no death upon them. I do not think ye will
find it easy to obtain these swine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>“Fifth, there is this. In a further land still,
that is called Irrua, there is a great and terrible
hound named Falinnish. So fierce is he that
whatever beast comes within sight of him falls
in helpless fear. I do not think ye will find
that hound very easy to obtain, or bring with
ye from far-off Irrua.</p>

<p>“Sixth, there is this. In the remote seas is
an isle called Fiancarya. It is there that the
sea-women dwell. In caverns beneath the
waves they roast their food. It is their roasting
spit I ask of ye. I do not think ye will
find it easy to obtain that thing.</p>

<p>“Seventh, there is this. The three apples
I ask of ye are of gold, and are in an ancient
garden in Isberna. That ancient close is well
guarded, O Sons of Turenn, so that ye may
not find it easy even to see the wind-waved
summits of the trees. I do not think ye will
bring back these apples.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>“And lastly, there is this. In the remotest
north of remote Lochlin there is a hill called
Mekween. It is so called from a man of that
name who lives there. He is a great and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
powerful man, and none others equal him save
only his two sons. So terrible are they that no
man dare venture into that wild place where
they live, save in amity. It was with them
that my father learned his great craft with the
sword; and so great will their wrath be that
ye have slain him, that even were I to forgive
ye, they would not. Moreover, Mekween and
his sons are under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> not to allow a shout to
be shouted upon that hill. I do not think ye
will find it easy to pass the sons of Mekween,
nor to shout three shouts upon that hill.”</p>

<p>With that, Lu the Ildanna bowed before the
king, and sat upon his golden chair again.</p>

<p>All men looked with sorrow upon the sons
of Turenn. Any of the seven <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geasan</i> of
this eric that Lu put upon them was more
than enough for any hero: how then would
they survive till the last, or, having survived,
how would they bring back with them these
things, and how escape the wrath of Mekween
and his sons?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the sons of Turenn were now
under bond, and they had no choice but to do
what they could to fulfil their eric.</p>

<p>With sad hearts they left the great beauty
and wonder of Tara, and with sadder hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
still reached their own land. Here with sorrow
they bade farewell to Turenn their father and
to dark-eyed Enya their sister, whom they
loved so passing well, and to all their kindred
and folk. Thereafter they set forth on their
long and ever more and more perilous quest.</p>

<p>It would have been easy for the sons of
Turenn to have passed over into Alba, and
sought service with the king of that country;
or to have gone among the Kymri in the inland
highlands beyond the isle where Manannan
had his home: or southward to Lyonesse
or into Armorica. But honour is a better
thing than ease, and it would ill have befit
heroes such as Brian and Ur and Urba to
have evaded their solemn troth. A bitter
wrong they had done, because of the hereditary
feud betwixt the clans of Turenn and
Kian: but now there was one thing only to
do, and that to fulfil the eric put upon them
by Lu, son of Kian. Moreover, Nuadh the
Ardree and Bove Derg, son of the Dagda,
and a score of the noblest lords in Erin
were their warranty that they would do this
thing.</p>

<p>So, one day of the days, they set forth from
Erin: and sad indeed were they when across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the foam they took their last look at Dun
Turenn and at the dear familiar hill of Ben
Edar.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>For that night Peterkin heard no more
of the story of the Fate of the Sons of
Turenn; but all the next evening, and the
next again, he sat entranced by the strange
moving tale of how Brian and Ur and Urba
one by one fulfilled the hard and perilous
conditions of their eric, and this until the sixth
was done.</p>

<p>But here, now, this tale cannot be told in
full. To tell it aright would need a volume
not less than this is.</p>

<p>It must suffice that after innumerable hardships,
after fierce cold and fiercer heat, after
hunger and thirst and daily perils by land
or sea, and strange and frightful encounters,
and hazardous fights with monsters and wild
men and kings and princes, the sons of Turenn
found themselves sailing towards the remote
north of Lochlin, having accomplished the six
seeming impossible conditions.</p>

<p>That nigh-impossible task, indeed, had been
made possible by the magic boat of Manannan,
called the Sweeper of the Waves, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
had won from Lu by unlooked-for wile.
For before they had left Tara they had
played a game of chess with Lu Ildanna,
well knowing that Lu was under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> never
to refuse to play at chess when asked by
any Dedannan, or to pay the hazard that
was decided upon, whatsoever it might be.
There was no player in all Erin to surpass
Ur, though few knew this, for he was little
given to talk, and still less of his own doings.</p>

<p>First Urba had offered to play with Lu,
and the hazard of that play was to be the
life of Lu Ildanna. “I will play that hazard,”
he said, “if thou wilt pay the like penalty
if thou dost lose.” But when Urba refused,
he could play no more, because he had
declined the counter-hazard.</p>

<p>Then Brian had offered to play, and the
hazard of that play was to be Daurya, the
beautiful daughter of a great lord, whom
Lu loved. “I will play that hazard,” he
said, “if, in return, thou wilt pledge me
Enya of the Dark Eyes, thy sister.” But
when Brian refused this hazard, he too could
play no more with Lu until Lu asked
him.</p>

<p>Then Ur played, and the hazard of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
play was the “Sweeper of the Waves,” Manannan’s
magic boat. “I will play that hazard,”
Lu said, “if in return thou wilt sail in
it, and affront Manannan to his face.” To
that Ur agreed, and they played, and Ur
won.</p>

<p>This magic boat would sail swiftly and safely
in any sea whether calm or tempest-wrought,
and at a word would make for any coast
or haven; more like a great bird it was, or
some creature of the air and sea.</p>

<p>“White shall be thy foamy track,” cried
Lu as they sailed away; “but red everywhere
shall be the wake behind ye.”</p>

<p>And so it was. For death and the bitterness
of the sword were ever in their way
and in their wake. Nevertheless, they unceasingly
rejoiced in their possession of the
Sweeper of the Waves, and when their eric-quest
took them into far eastern lands beyond
the reach of great rivers, they hid their precious
vessel, or bade it lie till it heard their summoning
voice.</p>

<p>And so at the last it happened that the
sons of Turenn won the three golden apples
out of the guarded close in Isberna; and by
craft and daring carried away from Sicily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
famous chariot and two steeds which had no
peer in all the world; and from Asol of the
Golden Pillars, who gave them in ransom for
his life, they took the seven deathless swine;
and from its cauldron in the heart of a
hostile city they snatched the terrible spear
of Pisarr; and the far-famed skin of healing
they brought away from the palace of Toosh,
king of Greece, whose head they left idly
rolling upon his marble floor; and in far
Irrua they put captivity upon the terrible
hound Falinnish; and in the wild seas of
Fiancarya they dared the sea-women in their
caverns under the waves, and took from them
the roasting spit that Lu had demanded.</p>

<p>All this they did, and much else in the
doing of these wonders. And now nothing
remained but to shout three shouts upon the
hill of Mekween; and to this end they sailed
blithely and swiftly towards the far north of
Lochlin.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in far-away Erin, Lu
Ildanna became aware, by his subtle magic
and knowledge, that the sons of Turenn had
one by one accomplished all but the last of
the bitter tasks of the eric he had set upon
them. He had not deemed this fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
possible, but while greatly he marvelled that
courage and endurance could so bring impossible
things to pass, he dreaded lest the
sons of Turenn should prevail in the last task
also. For if they came back to Erin with
all that great eric fulfilled, then would there
be a blood-shedding terrible indeed.</p>

<p>Moreover, Lu Ildanna, who saw far ahead
of the things of the moment, was even now
preparing for that second great battle upon
the Plain of Moytura which he knew would
come again; and a battle mightier and more
desperate than the last, or than ever was
seen in Erin before. Great warrior as he
was, and lordly as was the war-host of the
Dedannans, he feared this final battle unless
he had at least half of the eric he had set
upon the sons of Turenn&mdash;and, above all, the
Spear of Pisarr, the Skin of Healing, and the
War-chariot of the Sicilian king. Therefore
he longed for the return of his foes, the sons
of Turenn; yet feared that they should come
back having accomplished all.</p>

<p>So on a day of the days he made a deep
and potent spell, and sent this spell forth
to work its noiseless and invisible way across
land and sea and under the flaming sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the white glister of the stars, till it should
find the Sweeper of the Waves.</p>

<p>So forth that subtle spell went, and when
it reached at last the Sweeper of the Waves
it crawled stealthily into the great boat, and
wound itself about the weary bodies of Brian
and Ur and Urba, and moved into their
brains, filled as they were with dreams of Erin
and of home.</p>

<p>The spell was the spell of oblivion, but they
knew it not.</p>

<p>And so it chanced that they could no longer
understand why it was they sailed northward,
nor had they any memory of the last obligation
of the eric, and thought neither of Mekween
and his sons, nor of the doom put upon
them by Lu, nor of the vanity of all their
long quest and brave endurance if they returned
with the eric unfulfilled in the least
part.</p>

<p>It was with joy that they set their prow
for green Erin; and with joy that they saw
again its green grassy hills above its white
shores; and with joy that they recognised
Ben Edar and Dun Turenn; and with joy
that they kissed once more Turenn their father
and Enya of the Dark Eyes, their sister, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
knew themselves back at last from all their
weary wandering and endless peril and
strife.</p>

<p>Great was the marvelling at what they
brought back, and the oldest druids admitted
that never in the history of Erin had so great
a wonder been done.</p>

<p>Alas! theirs was but a brief joy.</p>

<p>Lu Ildanna said nothing till he had put
away all the treasures of that eric. Then he
said gravely:</p>

<p>“All is accomplished save one thing. Have
ye shouted three shouts upon the hill of Mekween?”</p>

<p>And as he spoke he broke the spell, so
that suddenly Brian and Ur and Urba remembered,
and with shame and grief had to
say that this last thing they had not done.</p>

<p>In vain did Turenn supplicate for his sons,
in vain even was the pleading of the king.
Lu had but one answer. “All else is as
nought if they have not done this thing&mdash;to
shout three shouts upon the hill of Mekween.”</p>

<p>So once more the sore-tried heroes set forth,
but with dim presentiments of woe; for now
they had neither the Skin of Healing nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the Sweeper of the Waves, for these had been
taken away by Lu, and he would not give
them again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they reached their goal. A
great and terrible fight was theirs with Mekween
and his sons Conn and Corc and Ae&mdash;the
most terrible fight, the old bards say, which
was ever fought between six men&mdash;for at the
beginning the sons of Turenn slew Mekween.</p>

<p>At dusk on that disastrous day six gashed
and mutilated men lay in the swoon of death.
Out of that swoon, three men never waked,
and these were Conn and Corc and Ae: and
two had not strength to move even when
they waked, and these were Ur and Urba;
and Brian alone staggered to his feet, and
stared through a mist of blood.</p>

<p>When at last the eldest of the sons of
Turenn looked upon his brothers, and saw
their glassy eyes staring idly at the sunrise, he
feared that they too were dead. Then he saw
that the pulse of life still flickered. Weak as
he was, he took first Ur upon his shoulders,
and bore him up the rocky slope to the ridge
of the hill of Mekween; and then returned
and bore Urba thither also.</p>

<p>Then it was that three thin, faint shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
went forth upon the hill, so thin and faint that
the browsing stags on the uplands did not lift
their heads.</p>

<p>Thus was it that the Great Eric was fulfilled.</p>

<p>But, alas! the piteous tale of their return.
None could tell aright that woe-stricken, death-weary
voyage of three dying men, upborne by
one hope only&mdash;that they might free their
name and clan from the eric put upon them,
and lay their accusing deaths at the feet of
Lu Ildanna.</p>

<p>Yet hardly might they do even this. For as
they drew nigh the coasts of Erin once more,
Ur and Urba spoke to Brian and supplicated
him to raise their heads, so that, before they
died, they might see again the green hills of
their beloved Banba, and high Ben Edar, and
their home Dun Turenn.</p>

<p>But to this Brian made answer:</p>

<p>“Dear brothers, too great is my weakness,
for I am now even as ye are. Lo! through my
gaping wounds one of these birds that skim
above us might fly, and be not snared within
me.”</p>

<p>After that, they spake no word till the galley
grided against the sands of Erin.</p>

<p>Soon all in Dun Turenn and in all the lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of Edar knew that Brian, Ur, and Urba
were come again; but sorrowful were they
indeed to see, instead of the three proud heroes,
only three wasted men like unto shadows.
Neither Ur nor Urba could speak, but Brian’s
voice could rise to a thin whisper.</p>

<p>With halting breath he bade his father
hasten to Tara, and tell Lu Lamfada that
now all the eric was paid at last; and then beseech
him, by his honour and fair name, and
for the glory of the old Dedannan faith, and
by the invocation of the Sun and Moon and
Wind, to lend to the three perishing sons of
Turenn, the Skin of Healing, so that their
lives might not flicker out as the flame of spent
torches.</p>

<p>But, alas! Lu would not yield to that prayer,
not even when the grey hairs of Turenn were
at his feet. Then once more Brian besought
his father; and now it was that he bade his
father put him upon a litter, and bear him
gently, because of his open wounds, and lay
him at the feet of Lu.</p>

<p>And when he was there, Brian said this
thing:</p>

<p>“Behold, O Lu Ildanna, son of Kian, we
have fulfilled the heaviest eric ever exacted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
any man since the world was made. And now
we ask this one thing alone: one hour only of
the Healing Skin that we ourselves brought
unto thee. Yet not for myself I ask this, if
thou desirest my life, since it was I who slew
thy father, but for my brothers Ur and Urba.
And if not for them&mdash;though they are guiltless
of this ill, and are with me in this dire plight
because they would not forsake me, but made
my fortune their fortune&mdash;then for the sake of
the old hero Turenn, who was comrade in
arms with thy father Kian when both were
youths. And by the Sun, and by the Moon,
and by the Wind, and by thine honour, I
cry to thee to be merciful, and to do this
thing.”</p>

<p>But Lu smiled a bitter, evil smile. Half
that smile was from the cruel revengefulness in
his breast, and half because he feared that if
Brian and Ur and Urba lived, there would
be an end of the Dedannan race, for the
fierce internecine wars which would be in
Erin.</p>

<p>“I would not give thee the Skin, Brian,
though all thy race, nay, not though every man
and woman in the eastlands were to perish
with thee. Go hence, and in the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
death remember the eric unto death of Lu the
Long-Handed.”</p>

<p>So Brian went forth upon his litter, with
the death-sweat already upon him.</p>

<p>That night a long and bitter lamentation
went up from Dun Turenn, and the Beacons of
Death flared upon Ben Edar. For, at the
setting of the sun, Brian and Ur and Urba
breathed out their souls into the light, and
these moved swift to Flathinnis, the holy island
where are gathered all the souls of heroes.</p>

<p>Yet on their way to join the innumerous
deathless dead, they halted once, for they heard
a thin voice crying upon the wind. It was
the voice of Turenn their father.</p>

<p>In one great grave before the mighty dun,
the four were buried, erect, and sword in hand.
And on a slab midway in the vast cairn of
stones that was erected thereon, was writ in
branching Ogam the names and glory of
Turenn and his three sons. For three days
the people wept. Then, as the wont was,
Enya of the Dark Eyes decreed the funeral
games.</p>

<p>And so these heroes died, and with them
went the third part of the perishing glory of
the Tuatha-De-Danann.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>For in the end, that which is to be, is. There
is no gainsaying the slow, sure word of Fate.
And, too, there is this thing to be said.
The wind in the grass outlasts the branching
Ogam graven in granite, and the granite cenotaph
itself, and the powdered dust of that
granite.</p>

Sons of Usna</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> story I will tell you now, Peterkin, is
more beautiful, though not so old.</p>

<p class="p074">In all the regions of the Gael throughout
Scotland, and in every isle, from Arran and
Islay in the south, to Iona in the west, and
Tiree in mid-sea, and the Outer Hebrides,
there is no story of the old far-off days so well
known as that of Darthool.</p>

<p>She it is who in Ireland is called Deirthrê or
Deirdrê; and in Ireland to this day there is not
a cowherd who has not heard of Deirdrê.</p>

<p>Her beauty filled the old world of the Gael
with a sweet, wonderful, and abiding rumour.
The name of Deirdrê has been as a lamp to a
thousand poets. In a land of heroes and brave
and beautiful women, how shall one name survive?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Yet to this day and for ever, men will
remember Deirdrê, the torch of men’s thoughts,
and Grainne whom Diarmid loved and died
for, and Maev who ruled mightily, and Fand
whose white feet trod faery dew, and many
another. For beauty is the most excellent
sweet thing in all the world, and though of it a
few perish, and a myriad die from knowing
nothing of it, beneath it the nations of men
move forward as their one imperishable star.
Therefore he who adds to the beauty of the
world is of the sons of God. He who destroys
or debases beauty is of the darkness, and shall
have darkness for his reward.</p>

<p>The day will come, Peterkin, when you will
find a rare and haunting music in these names.
They will bring you a lost music, a lost world,
and imperishable beauty. You will dwell with
them, till you love Deirdrê as did the sons of
Usna, and would die for her, or live to see her
starry eyes; till you look longingly upon the
Grainne of your dreams, and cry as Diarmid
did, when he asked her, as death menaced
them, if even yet she would go back, and she
answered that she would not: “Then go forward,
O Grainne!”</p>

<p>Many poets and shennachies have related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
this tale. I have heard it given now this way,
and now that; sometimes with new names and
scenes, sometimes with other beginnings and
endings; but at heart it is ever the same. Nor
does it matter whether the father of Deirdrê be
Felim, the warrior bard of the Ultonians, or
Malcolm the Harper, or any other, or whether
the fair and sweet beauty of the world be called
Deirdrê or Darthool. But as here in our own
land she is called Darthool, that I will call her.</p>

<p>I will tell the story as it is told in the old
chronicles, and to this day, and if I add aught
to it, that shall only be what I myself heard
when I was young, and had from the lips of
an old woman, Barabal Mac-Aodh, who was
my nurse. She came out of Tiree or Coll, I
forget which.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Well, in the ancient dim days when Emania
was the capital of the Ultonians, the fair and
wonderful capital of the kingdom of Ulster,
and before Maev, the queen of the south, had
buried the chivalry of the north in dust and
blood, there came into the realm of Concobar
the Ultonian king, whom some call Conor and
some Connachar, three of the noblest and
fairest of the youths of the world. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
they who then bore, and in all the years since
have borne, the name of the Sons of Usna, who
was himself, some say, a feudal king, in Alba.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>It is because of these three heroes that this
story I am relating is often called the story
of the Sons of Usna. But first, I have that to
tell you which precedes the time when Nathos,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
and Ailne, and Ardan, stood in the house of
Concobar the high king.</p>

<p>This Concobar was a great prince. He was
known as Concobar MacNessa, for though he
was the son of Fatna the Wise, son of Ross
the Red, son of Rory, Nessa his mother was a
famous queen, and had indeed by her beauty
and her wiles brought Concobar to the overlordship
of Uladh<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> when he was yet a youth.</p>

<p>In many of the tales of the old far-off days,
you will hear the rumour of the splendour and
wonder of the city of Emania. In Concobar’s
time it was called Emain Macha, for it had
been built by a great and beautiful queen&mdash;Macha
Mongruay, Macha of the Ruddy Hair.
A thousand times have poets chanted of Emain
Macha, and in the ancient days the bards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
loved to sing also of Macha herself. Here is
an old far-off lay:</p>

</div>

<p>It was in this wonderful forefront of Ulster
that Concobar reigned. The fame of Emain
Macha was throughout Gaeldom; and there
was no man or woman who, as the days went
by, did not hear of the greatness of Concobar.</p>

<p>On a day of the days, the king went with
his chief lords on a visit to the dun of Felim,
a warrior and harper whom he loved. There
was to be great feasting, and all men were
glad. Felim himself rejoiced, though he would
fain have had the king come to him a few days
later, for his wife was heavy with child, and
looked for her hour that very day or the next.</p>

<p>In the midmost of the feast, Concobar saw
that Cathba, an aged Druid who had accompanied
him, was staring into the other world
that is about us.</p>

<p>“Speak, Cathba,” he said. “There is no
man in all Erin who has wisdom like unto
thine. What is it that thou seest, with the
inner sight that I perceive well is now upon
thee?”</p>

<p>“Old as I am with the heavy burden of
years and sorrow, O Concobar, did I not beg
that I might come with thee to this festival at
the dun of Felim? And that was not because
I wearied to hear strange harping and singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
good and fine and better than our own as this
harping is here, in the house of Felim; for I
am old and weary, and care more to listen to
the wind in the grass, or to the sighing upon
the hill, than to any music of war or love.”</p>

<p>“Then what was it that was in thy mind,
Cathba?”</p>

<p>“This, O king. I saw a shadow arise whenever
I thought of our Ultonian realm, and I
felt within me the burden of a new prophecy.
Nevertheless, I was moved by naught till I
entered the dun of Felim, and now I know.”</p>

<p>“Speak,” said the king; while all there
listened with awe as well as eagerness, for
Cathba was the wisest of the Druids, and knew
many mysteries, and what he had foretold had
ever come to pass. Slowly, the white-haired
Druid looked around the faces of all seated
there. Then he looked at the king. Then he
looked at Felim.</p>

<p>“To thee, O Felim, shall be born this night
a sting, a sword, a battering-ram, and a flame.”</p>

<p>Felim the Harper stared with intent gaze,
but said nothing. Of what avail to say aught
against the decrees of the gods?</p>

<p>“This night shall that which I have said be
born unto thee, O Felim. The sting will sting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
to madness him who is king of the Ultonians;
the sword will sever from Uladh the chief of
her glories, the proud Red Branch for which
Concobar and all his chivalry shall perish; the
ram shall batter down the proud splendour of
Emain Macha; the flame shall pass from dun
to dun, from forest to forest, from hill to hill,
from the isles of Ara on the west to the shores
of the sea-stream of the Moyle on the north,
and to those of the sea of Manannan in the east.”</p>

<p>Still Felim answered nothing. Then the
king spoke:</p>

<p>“Thy words come in dust, like wind-whirled
autumn leaves. We have not thy further sight,
Cathba, and understand thee not.”</p>

<p>Then once more Cathba spake out of the
dream that was upon him:</p>

<p>“Two stars I see shining in a web of dusk;
and, in the shadow of that dusk, a low tower of
ivory and white pearls I see, and a strange crimson
fruit; and through all and over all I hear the
low, sweet vibration of the strings of a harp, a
harp such as the Dedannan folk play upon in
the moonshine in lonely places, but sweeter
still, sweeter and more wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Is this thy second vision one and the same
with thy first, O Cathba?” asked the king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>“Even so. For the shining stars are her
eyes, and the web of dusk is the flower-fragrant
maze of her hair, that low tower of
ivory is her fair, white, wonderful neck, and her
white teeth are these pearls, and that strange
crimson fruit is no other than her smiling
mouth&mdash;a little smiling mouth with life and
death upon it because of its laughter and grave
stillness. As for that harp-playing, it is her
voice I hear&mdash;a voice more soft and sweet and
tender than the love-music of Angus Ogue
himself. O shining eyes, O strange crimson
fruit that is a little smiling mouth, O sweet
voice that is more excellent to hear than the
wild music of the Hidden People of the hills&mdash;it
is of ye, of ye that I speak, and of thee,
O tender, delicate fawn, in all thy loveliness.”</p>

<p>None spake, but all stared at the Druid.
For dream was upon them at these words, and
each man imagined his desire, and was wrought
by it, and was rapt in strange longing.</p>

<p>It was Concobar who broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Of whomsoever thou speakest, Cathba, she
is surely of the divine folk. That exceeding
loveliness is for the joy or the sorrow of the
world.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>Only Felim the Harper was troubled, for
now he knew well that the ancient Druid
spoke of the unborn child with whom even
then his wife was in travail. But no sooner
had Concobar ceased than Cathba rose, with
his great dark eyes aflame beneath his white
eye-brows. His voice was loud and terrible.</p>

<p>“Behold, I see this thing; behold the vision
of Cathba the Druid, who is old and nigh unto
death. And what is before mine eyes is a
sea, a sea of flowing crimson, a sea of blood.
Foaming it rises, and wells forth, and overflows,
and drowns great straths and valleys, and
laves the flanks of high hills, and from the
summits of mountains pours down upon the
lands of the Gael in a thundering flood, blood-red
to the blood-red sea.”</p>

<p>But now the spell of silence was broken.
All leaped to their feet, and many put their
hands upon their swords. There was not one
who did not fear the prophesying of Cathba
the wise Druid. That deluge of blood, was it
not a terror, a great ruin to avert?</p>

<p>“If this child that the wife of Felim the
Harper is to bear this night be a blood-bringer
so terrible,” they cried, “let us slay her at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
birth. For surely it is better to kill a child
than to destroy a nation.”</p>

<p>So spake they out of their ignorance that
they thought wisdom. For they did not know
that there is no thought, no power, no spell, no
craft, wherewith to turn aside the feet of Destiny.
What has to be, will be, and no man
living can say or do aught that is of avail
against the inevitable tides of Fate.</p>

<p>For the first time since Cathba had prophesied,
Felim uttered word.</p>

<p>“Listen, my kinsmen and fellow-knights of
the Red Branch. A sore pity is it for my wife
Elva to bear a daughter that shall be a sting
to sting the king to madness, and a sword to
sever the Red Branch from Uladh, our fair
heritage, and a ram to break down the walls
of Emania, and a flame to consume the land
from shore to shore. And as for that sea of
blood, let it not be upon my head. For I, the
father of the child of Elva, that Cathba says is
to be a woman-child and of a beauty wonderful
to see, say unto ye: That which ye would fain
do, do. If it seems good unto ye, O Concobar,
and ye of the Red Branch, let this child
perish, so that the doom foretold by Cathba
may be averted.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>At that all were glad save Concobar. Two
men was he, this king: a man who recked
little of aught save his desire, and a man who
had wisdom. Out of his wisdom he knew that
Felim and the Red Branch lords spoke madness,
for if it was ordained that the child of
Elva should bring doom, that doom would
surely come. Out of his longing he loved the
beauty of which Cathba had spoken, and desired
it against the years to come, and for the
solace of his years when he had loved much
and at the last was fain only of that which was
the crown of life. So he spoke to those before
him, and prevailed with them. Not vainly was
he called Concobar of the Honeymouth.</p>

<p>“I will speak first to thee, Felim, son of
Dall, my bard. It is not good to put death
upon the fruit of one’s loins. Thine own child
should not see death through thee. But even
were it so, it is not meet for me or for any one
to bring the shame and pain of death to the
house of a friend. Therefore, do not speak of
putting silence and darkness upon the child of
Elva.”</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, the king turned to the
lords of the Red Branch. As the wont was,
at the royal festivals there were five and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
score over three hundred of the Red Branch
there and then.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>“And to ye, Ultonians, I say this thing also.
Do not bring blood into the hospitable home
of Felim; that would be a stain upon him,
upon ye yourselves, and upon me the king.
But this is my counsel. Let the child live.
There is no good in idle blood, and if ye stain
yourselves with it, there shall be greater loss
and sorrow to follow. Ye are all grown men,
and not boys who do not know our laws. Ye
know the Law of the Eric. Well, I will free ye
of all doom, for upon my head be it. To myself
I will take this fair child, and upon me, and
not upon the Ultonians, nor upon the Red
Branch, nor upon any other whomsoever save
Concobar MacNessa, the high king, be the
penalty, if penalty there be.”</p>

<p>At that a son of a king arose.</p>

<p>“That is well, O Concobar. But what of
Cathba’s prophecy? We do not wish to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the sting that shall sting thee to madness, and
if the child live shall we not see that sting?”</p>

<p>“Of that I have thought, that I have foreseen,
Congal, son of Rossa of the Lakes. For
I shall send the child into a lonely place, and
there in a solitary rath shall she dwell and
grow in years, and no man shall look upon her
save I myself, and that only in the fulness of
time. She shall be solitary and apart as the
Crane of Innisbea, that has dwelt upon its isle
since the world was made, and is seen of none.”</p>

<p>“Tell us once more, Concobar MacNessa;
dost thou take this child, and the doom of this
child unto thee, and to thee alone?”</p>

<p>“I have sworn. She shall grow in years,
and be wife to me when the time is come.
And if sorrow come with her, that sorrow shall
be my sorrow. Not upon Uladh be it, but
upon me. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>“And as for thee, Felim?”</p>

<p>“It would be better to slay the child than to
drown the land in blood.”</p>

<p>“And as for thee, Cathba?”</p>

<p>“There is but one law: that which has to
come, cometh.” But while they were thus
debating, the loud chanting voices of women
were heard, and soon a messenger came, crying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
loudly that a child had been born to Elva,
wife of Felim, and that it was a woman-child, and
exceeding comely, and strong, and white as milk.</p>

<p>Once more Cathba the Druid spoke.</p>

<p>“She shall be called Darthool,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> this woman
whose beauty shall be a flame, and whose eyes
shall be as stars.”</p>

<p>And so it was. The child was spared, and
that night Elva slept in peace, and for many
nights.</p>

<p>When the days of the feasting were over,
Concobar left the dun of Felim, and returned
with all his company to Emania. With him
he took the little child Darthool, and Elva
came with him for a month and a day.</p>

<p>The month and the day soon passed, and
then Elva went back to her own place. It was
the will of the high king and of Felim, her
husband; nevertheless, she sorrowed to part
with her little child, who, even as a breast-babe,
had eyes of so great a beauty that it was
a joy to look into them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Before the year was over&mdash;for, according to
what Cathba the wise Druid said, the child
must either be slain or hidden away before the
first year of her life were past&mdash;Concobar sent
Darthool with the nursing woman to whom he
entrusted her, to a small <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lios</i>, or fort, deep
in the heart of the royal forest. A ban
was upon that forest that none might hunt or
even stray there without the king’s will; and
now that ban was made absolute, and it was
known that death would be the portion of any
man who went under these branches. None
was to enter that woodland save Concobar, or
whosoever might be of his chosen company,
or whom the king might thither lead.</p>

<p>Concobar himself saw that food and milk was
sent in plenty to the lios, and once in every
seven days he went thither himself. As year
after year passed the secret of the hiding-place
of Darthool went out of men’s minds, and none
knew of the lios save the king, and the sister
of the nursing woman, who was his own foster-child
and under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> or bond to him. This
woman was named Lavarcam (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Leabharcham</i>),
and was fair to see, and whom Concobar held
to be discreet and trustworthy beyond any
other of his own people. She was of the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
household, and of the women trained as chroniclers
and relaters.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The little starry-eyed babe grew to a child,
and from a child to a fawn of a girl, fair to see,
and from a young girl to a maid, of a beauty so
great that Concobar knew when she came to
full womanhood she would be indeed as Cathba
the Druid had prophesied.</p>

<p>Darthool saw no one but her nurse, and
the tutor whom the king had sent to teach
her all that could be taught, and not only in
learning, but in courtesy and nobility; and
Lavarcam, who alone went to and fro. From
the time that Darthool passed out of her first
girlhood the king saw little of her, but twice
in each year&mdash;at the Festival of the Sun in
the time of the greening, and at the Festival
of end Summer at the fall of the leaf; and this
because of a warning that had been given
him by Cathba the ancient Druid.</p>

<p>How can the beauty of so fair and sweet a
woman be revealed? Her loveliness was even
as Cathba had foretold. It was a surpassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
loveliness, and the three women who saw her
often marvelled at it, and wondered no more
that Darthool should be kept apart, for of a
surety she would be a torch to put flame into
the hearts of men, and to set great duns and
raths and towered capitals and warring nations
ablaze. The poets have sung of her, and no
man has sung but out of his deep desire. Her
great sad eyes, so full of dream, were blue as
are the hill-tarns at noon, and often dusky as
they when passing clouds put purple into their
depths; and like a golden web her hair was,
sprayed out with shining light, wonderful,
glorious; and her rowan-red lips were indeed
that strange crimson fruit which Cathba had
foreseen&mdash;rowan-red against the cream-white
softness of her skin. Cream-white her body
was, and her neck like a tower of ivory; slim
and graceful was she as a fawn, and fleet of foot
as the wild roes on the hills, and when she
moved in the sunlight or the shadow she was
so beautiful that tears came at times to the eyes
of the women in that lonely place. Yet even
more wonderful was her voice&mdash;low and sweet
and with music in it, like the whisper of the
wind among the reeds, or the ripple of green
leaves, or the murmuring of a brook.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>But now and from this time forth Concobar
did not see her. For a year and a day after
she attained womanhood, Cathba had warned
the king it would mean death to him if he saw
her. Nevertheless, he often heard of Darthool
from Lavarcam, who in her going to and fro
had ever one thing to say&mdash;that never had
there been any woman so beautiful.</p>

<p>The rumour of this great loveliness spread
from lip to lip. Yet no man ventured to
seek out the hidden place where Darthool
dwelled, for to all it was known that Concobar
kept her there against the time when he would
make her his queen, and all feared the long
arm and the heavy hand of Concobar Mac
Nessa. None might even question the king.</p>

<p>It was in this year that the shadows of the
feet of Fate came into that place.</p>

<p>One day when Lavarcam told the king that
Darthool grew fairer and fairer, so that even
the wild creatures of the forest rejoiced in her,
he all but yielded to his desire. Nevertheless,
fearing the prophetic voice, he refrained, but
cried: “When the snow time has passed, and
the first greening is over, and the wild rose
runs like a flame throughout the land, then will
I go to Darthool.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>But before the greening was lost in the tides
of summer, and before the wild rose had begun
to run like a windy flame throughout the land,
Concobar had learned that Destiny waits on no
man.</p>

<p>One dawn the first snows came over the hills
of the north and fell upon the forest. At the
rising of the sun they ceased, but every branch
was a white plume, and every glade was
smooth and white as was the breast of Darthool
herself. There was no wind in the deep
blue sky, but the air was sharp and sweet
because of the frost. For joy Darthool
clapped her hands, as she stood upon the wall
of the lios.</p>

<p>Then, glancing downward, she beheld the
woman who was her attendant standing beside
a calf that had been slain for the provisioning
of those within the fort. The red blood
streamed over the snow, and was as the crimson
cloak of an Ultonian chief there, till the red
grew mottled as it sank through the frozen
whiteness.</p>

<p>Darthool’s eyes ever saddened at the sight
of blood, but after a brief while she knew that
there was no harm in that shedding, and that
no omen of further bloodspilling lay therein.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
While she was still looking thereon, a great
raven, glossy black and burnished in the sun
rays, came gliding swift across the snow, and
alit by the slain calf, and drank of the warm
bright blood.</p>

<p>Of a sudden Darthool laughed low. It was
a sweet shy laugh, and Lavarcam, who had
come to her side, asked her why there was
such sweet low laughter upon her. Mayhap
she knew; mayhap she guessed that Darthool
dreamed dreams of love, because her womanhood
was now come, and because of the old
heroic tales she took so great a pleasure in, and
because of the vision that every woman has in
her heart.</p>

<p>“I was thinking, Lavarcam,” she said.</p>

<p>“And what was that thought, Darthool?”</p>

<p>“It was this: that if there be anywhere a
youth whose skin is white as that whiteness
there, and whose locks are as dark and glossy
as the plumage of that raven, and in whose
cheek is a crimson as red as that blood that is
upon the snow, then of a surety him could I
love, and that gladly.”</p>

<p>For a moment Lavarcam said nought; then
the power of Destiny moved her.</p>

<p>“There is one man who is more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
than all others I have ever seen. He is young,
and his hair is dark and glossy as that raven’s
wing, and in his cheek the ruddy flame is as
that crimson blood, and his skin is as white as
any sunlit whiteness, or as thine own breast,
Darthool.”</p>

<p>“And what will be the name of that man,
Lavarcam, and whence is he and where, and
what is his decree?”</p>

<p>“He is called Nathos, and is the son of
Usna, who is a great lord in Alba. But he is
now in Emania, among the company of the
king; and with him are his brothers, both fair
to see, and princes among men because of their
beauty and valour, yet neither so surpassing all
men as Nathos. They are called Ailne and
Ardan.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>That was a fatal saying of Lavarcam, for it
sank into the mind of Darthool as moonlight
into dark water.</p>

<p>Day by day thereafter she thought of nothing
but of meeting this proud son of beauty;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
night by night she dreamed of Nathos and of
his love.</p>

<p>At the last, Lavarcam was filled with fear,
for she saw that her words had awakened the
flaming lion that lies hid in the heart. And
truly it was not long till Darthool spoke to
her of her longing and deep desire, and how
that without Nathos she did not care to
live.</p>

<p>For a time Lavarcam smiled; but when she
saw that the king’s beautiful ward was ever
growing more and more wrought, her heart
smote her.</p>

<p>One day, as she was returning from Emain
Macha, she met a swineherd, clad roughly in
the fell of a deer, and with him were two men,
rude, dishevelled hillmen, bondagers to the
Ultonians.</p>

<p>These, notwithstanding the law of Concobar,
she took with her into the forest, and bade
them await at a well that was there, until they
heard the cry of a jay and the bark of a hill-fox,
when they were to move slowly on their
way, but to speak to no one whom they might
meet, and above all to be silent after they left
the shadow of the wood.</p>

<p>Having done this, she entered the lios, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
asked Darthool to come forth with her into the
woods.</p>

<p>When they drew near to the well, Lavarcam
moved aside to look for some rare herb, as she
said. Soon the cry of the jay and the bark of
the hill-fox were in the air.</p>

<p>“That is a strange thing,” Darthool said to
her, when she was by her side again; “for that
cry of the jay was the cry it gives in April, at
the nesting time, and the bark of that hill-fox
was the bark it gives in the season of the rut,
many months agone.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” said Lavarcam, “and look.”</p>

<p>They stood still, as they saw the swineherd
and the two hillmen rise from near the well,
and move slowly across the glade.</p>

<p>“Who are these, Lavarcam?” asked Darthool,
with wonder in her eyes.</p>

<p>“These are men, daughter of Felim.”</p>

<p>“They are younger than those I have seen
from the outskirts of the forest, but they are
wild in dress and mien, and are not of high
degree, and my eyes have no pleasure in looking
upon them.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” answered Lavarcam, “these
are the three sons of Usna&mdash;Nathos and Ailne
and Ardan.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>For a brief while Darthool looked upon
them. Then she spoke.</p>

<p>“The truth flew past thy lips, Lavarcam.
Yonder man whom ye name Nathos has
neither raven hair nor white skin, nor the
comely red in his face; and the two others are
like the slaves I saw that day I beheld the
foster-brothers of Concobar driving back from
battle, in a chariot dragged by wild rough men
in bondage. I remember the day, for it was
then that thou bade me know that death was the
portion of any man who sought me. That, too,
I fear was no true word. Howsoever, as to
these men, they may go. And yet&mdash;&mdash; wait.”</p>

<p>And with that Darthool moved swiftly forward,
and, coming upon the three men by a
by-path through the fern, confronted them.</p>

<p>They stood amazed at her exceeding great
beauty. Nothing like it was in the whole
world; so, little wonder that these boors stood
as though the face of death was bare to them;
for beauty is strange and terrible to most
men, and they are prone to stand in dread
of it.</p>

<p>None spake. Darthool looked at each, a
slow smile of mocking in her lips, a blue flame
of scorn in her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>“Are ye the sons of Usna?”</p>

<p>They made no answer, but stared unwaveringly
upon her, as do the dull cattle in the
fields.</p>

<p>“What brave courtesy!” she cried, mocking
with her sweet voice, “how swift in courtesy!
Tell me, Nathos, son of Usna, is it the wont of
thy people in Alba to stand by agape when a
woman speaks? Who is Usna, or what? If
he is a king, is he overlord of swineherds? If
it is a place, is it the rough bogs of the hills
where sword-clad men do not go, but only a
poor folk clad rudely in skins?”</p>

<p>Still they answered nothing.</p>

<p>“Were ye whipt into silence when ye were
young, ye that stand there wordless as dogs?
If indeed ye be the sons of Usna, then truly
Concobar MacNessa must be in sore want of
men at Emain Macha!”</p>

<p>At that the swineherd could no longer hold
to his bond.</p>

<p>“By thy great exceeding beauty I know that
thou art no other than Darthool, whom the
king hides in this place. But do not mock us,
who would rather worship thee. We are no
nobles, but a swineherd, and two hillmen who
are bondagers to Cairbre of the Three Duns.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>At that Darthool laughed gently.</p>

<p>“That I knew full well, swineherd, for all
that I dwell here apart and see none of my
kind, save Maev my nurse and Aeifa my tutor
and Lavarcam the friend of the king. Those
I have seen otherwise have been beheld a great
way off, from where I laid hid in the woods.
But now, wilt thou do one thing for me?”</p>

<p>“I will give thee my life.”</p>

<p>Darthool smiled into the man’s eyes, and
what was only the swineherd died, and a strong
heroic soul arose in him.</p>

<p>“I would fain see Nathos, the eldest of the
sons of Usna.”</p>

<p>“That is against the law of Concobar: and
long is the arm and heavy the hand of Concobar
MacNessa the high king. But what
is death to me, since thou willest me to do this
thing for thee, Darthool of the beautiful eyes?
Nay, I swear this thing: that rather would I
die by torture, and please thee, than live out
my life and refuse thee of what thou art fain.
For thy beauty is upon me like the light of the
moon at the full on the dark moorland. I am
thine.”</p>

<p>Darthool looked at the man. Suddenly she
stooped and kissed him on the wind-furrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
brow. Great fortune was his, and he was well
repaid for his death by blunt spear-shafts, when
Concobar knew all. For what is death, when
a man has reached beyond the limit of his
desire?</p>

<p>“Then go this night to Nathos, and tell him
that I, Darthool, dream of him by day and by
night, and that if he is in anywise fain of me,
let him come to me to-morrow, an hour before
the setting of the sun, at this well.”</p>

<p>With that she turned and walked slowly
back to where Lavarcam awaited her. As they
moved homeward through the wood, Lavarcam
saw that the dream in the eyes of Darthool had
deepened. It was in vain then, or later, that
she sought to know what the fair, beautiful girl
had said to the swineherd. She feared, however,
that Darthool no longer trusted her
because of the lie that she had told, and that
mayhap the girl had plotted somewhat with
the swineherd.</p>

<p>All the morrow Lavarcam watched Darthool
closely, but she seemed rapt in vision, and
cared neither to chase the fawns, nor to fish,
nor even to wander idly through the woods.
No speech would she have with any one, and
said only that she wished to lie under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
boughs of the great oak in front of the lios, and
sleep.</p>

<p>“How can that be, when there is snow upon
the ground?” Lavarcam asked.</p>

<p>“Is there snow upon the ground?” answered
Darthool dreamily. “Then I will lie upon my
deerskins, and Aeifa can play to me and sing
me songs till dusk.”</p>

<p>Hearing that, Lavarcam was glad, for now
she could leave the lios with a mind at rest.</p>

<p>So, in the wane of the day, she passed
through the forest and came out upon the great
plain in front of Emain Macha, and went to
seek the king to take counsel with him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lavarcam was sore wrought
by Darthool, and would fain have given her
her heart’s desire. Piteous indeed had her
plaints been. With tears and reproaches and
sweet beseechings nigh intolerable, Darthool
had begged her to bring Nathos to her, if for
once only, so that she might at least see him,
and know what her heart’s desire was like.
Moreover, was it not a bitter thing for her to
be kept there in that lonely place, and neither
to see nor converse with her own kind, and to
be kept away from all the joys of youth, and to
pass from spring to summer, and from summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to autumn, and from autumn to winter, yea and
from year to year, and be exiled there, to hear
no young voices, no young laughter? When
she pleaded thus, Lavarcam was sorrowful
indeed, for she had the heart of a woman, and
knew the beauty and the wonder and the
mystery of love.</p>

<p>Thinking of these things, her heart smote her
as she fared towards Emain Macha, and at the
last she decided to say no word to the king as
to what she feared Darthool may have told the
swineherd. Furthermore, she muttered, what
was death to her who had known all that life
had to give her? At the worst, Concobar
could put death upon her. Had she not lived
and known love, and now was weary?</p>

<p>When she drew nigh to Emain Macha she
saw three ravens and three hoodie-crows and
three kites arise from some carrion hidden in
the long grass that waved there.</p>

<p>When she came upon it, she saw that it was
the body of the swineherd, loose with the
gaping wounds of blunt spear-shafts. In thus-wise
she knew that Concobar had in some way
heard of what the man had done.</p>

<p>Yet she had no fear from that. The swineherd
was still now. Neither king nor raven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
neither man nor hoodie-crow, neither spear-shaft
nor kite could now hurt him. It was
better to be alive than to be dead, but it was
well to be dead.</p>

<p>So Lavarcam turned, and went over to the
camp in Emain Macha where the sons of
Usna were. There she saw Nathos, and
told him privily that Darthool longed to see
him, and that the forest was open to the
stealthy flight of the owl as well as to the
soaring hawk.</p>

<p>Nathos was indeed fair to see, and looking
upon him Lavarcam knew in her heart that
Darthool would love him, and he her. He
listened, and she saw his eyes deepen, and
a flush come and go upon his face. For
sure there was a beating swift of his pulse in
that hour.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he could not come straightway,
for Concobar knew that the swineherd had
spoken to him of Darthool, and it was for this,
and having seen and spoken with the girl, that
the king had put the man to death&mdash;though for
that, added Nathos, little did the swineherd
care, for he died laughing and mocking, and,
when he lay still, there was a smile upon his
face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>“And that was because Darthool had looked
into his eyes, Nathos, son of Usna.”</p>

<p>“Truly, he died well. I know a prince
among men who also would die gladly if Darthool
would look into his eyes with love.”</p>

<p>“Then come soon and hunt the deer in the
solitudes to the north of the forest: and there,
amid the woods, or in some glen, or on the
hill-slopes, surely thou shalt meet with Darthool&mdash;and
yet none know of it.”</p>

<p>So Lavarcam and Nathos made a bond
between them, and parted.</p>

<p>Thereafter days passed. On the morrow
of the seventh day Darthool was wandering
among the glades and thickets of the uplands
far away from the lios, rejoicing in her new
freedom and hoping that one day her eyes
might look upon Nathos. She was dreaming
her dream, when she started at a strange sound,
the like of which she had never heard.</p>

<p>That far-off baying of hounds she knew, for
oftentimes of old Concobar had ridden to the
forest with his deerhounds: but that strange,
wild, blazoning sound&mdash;&mdash; Was it the
voice of the flying creature the hounds pursued?</p>

<p>Then the thought came to her that it was
the hunting horn she had often heard of in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
songs and war-ballads which Lavarcam and
Aeifa were wont to sing to her.</p>

<p>But after that blast the horn no more tore
the silence of the deep woods, and the hounds
were still: for Nathos had left the chase of the
deer and was now moving listless through the
green glooms of the forest. Night and day
since Lavarcam and the swineherd had told him
of Darthool he had dreamed of the beautiful
daughter of Felim the Harper. Remembering
the last chant of Cathba the Druid, he recalled
how Darthool had been named the Beauty of
the World, and because he was himself a poet
and a dreamer the vision had become part of
his life, so that neither by night nor by day was
there any hour wherein he did not see in his
mind the tall, white-robed figure of Darthool,
and the beauty of her eyes, and her face as the
sweet wild face of a dream.</p>

<p>And so dreaming he stood at the edge of a
glade, his swift eyes watching a fawn dispart a
thicket that was close by. Yet it was no fawn
as he thought: but rather was it as though a
sudden flood of sunshine burst forth in that
place. For a woman came from the thicket more
beautiful than any dream he had ever dreamed.
She was clad in a saffron robe over white that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
was like the shining of the sun on foam of the
sea, and this was claspt with great bands of
yellow gold, and over her shoulders was the
golden rippling flood of her hair, the sprays of
which lightened into delicate fire, and made a
mist before him, in the which he could see
her eyes like two blue pools wherein purple
shadows dreamed.</p>

<p>So exceeding great was her beauty that
Nathos did not think of her as Darthool or as
any mortal woman, but rather as a daughter
of the elder gods, or of that bright divine race
of the Tuatha-De-Danann, whose beauty surpassed
that of human beings as the beauty of
the primrose bank that of the brown sod. He
looked upon her amazed, and in a silent worship.
If she were indeed of the Dedannan
folk, she might disappear at any moment as a
shadow goes, that now is here asleep upon the
grass and in the twinkling of an eye is among
the things of oblivion.</p>

<p>At last speech rose to his lips.</p>

<p>“O fair and wonderful one, whom I see well
art of the old sacred race of the Tuatha-De-Danann,
may I have word with thee? It may
well be that thou art no other than the wife of
Midir himself, she who lives in a fair shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
grianan in the hollow of a hill, and lives upon
the beauty and fragrance of flowers.” Darthool
looked at him, and her heart beat. He
was in truth fair to see: fairer even than him
whom she had imaged in her dreams, or him of
whom Lavarcam had spoken.</p>

<p>“Speak. What wouldst thou?”</p>

<p>“I am faring idly through this lonely land,
and I know not where I am. Yonder, in the
valley behind the oak-glade, is a high-walled
rath. Is it a place of the Shee, and so forbidden?
or who dwells there, and shall a spear
or welcome greet me if I enter?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, thou mayst enter there, and a
welcome awaits thee, O Nathos, son of Usna.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest my name, O fair one; then,
indeed, thou art of the old wondrous race, who
know swifter than our thought, and whose
sight is further and deeper than our sight.”</p>

<p>“I am no queen, Nathos, nor am I of the
Tuatha-De-Danann, but am a woman as other
women are. If I am beautiful in thine eyes, of
that I am right glad, for thou art fairer to me
than any man I have seen or dreamed of, and
my pulse leaps when thine eyes look into mine.
I am Darthool, the daughter of Felim the
Harper; yet am I no better than a slave, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
here am I bound to stay, and see no one save
Lavarcam and my two women, and here I shall
die for loneliness and longing.”</p>

<p>Nathos heard her sweet low voice with delight,
and it was with joy at his heart he knew
she was no strange Dedannan but a woman
of his own race, and that she was Darthool.
Love rose suddenly within him like a flame:
a red flame was it that was in his heart, and a
white flame in his mind, and out of these two
flames is wrought the love of love and the
passion of passion and the dream of dreams.</p>

<p>“Art thou, indeed, Darthool?” he whispered;
“art thou that Darthool of whom I have
dreamed? Strange is the strangeness of this
meeting, O white daughter of Felim. For so
great is thy beauty that I was fain to believe I
saw before me one of the queens of the Tuatha-De-Danann.
But is this thing true, that against
thine own will Concobar the high king keeps
thee here like a trapped bird among these
woods?”</p>

<p>“True it is, and more: for it is not even
by Concobar’s will that I roam the woodlands.
He was fain that I should never leave
the rath save with Lavarcam, and that I should
spend most of my days within the stone walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
of the dreary lios where he has doomed me to
dwell.”</p>

<p>“Darthool, my heart is filled with a rising
tide. That tide is love. Thou hast not seen
the sea: but there, when the tide flows, there is
nothing, there is no one, in all the world, which
can say it nay. So is my love for thee, that
now rises; and, once thine, will be thine evermore.
Yet I would not put this upon thee;
and if thy words and looks come out of thy
frank, sweet courtesy and open maidenly heart,
and mean no more than that thou carest for me
as a brother, it is thy brother I will be, Darthool,
to serve thee and succour thee and love
thee evermore, and in that way only.”</p>

<p>For a brief while she looked at him. Then
the noon-blue of her eyes deepened, and a flush
drifted through her face and waned into the
deeper red of her parted lips.</p>

<p>“Nathos,” she said in a low voice, which
trembled as a reed in the wind, “I, too, love.
It is thee I love. If it be wrong for me, a
maiden, to speak thus, forgive me, for I have
grown wilding here, and am more akin to
the fawns of the forest than to women kind
of mine own age or estate. But I love thee,
Nathos: as of old, in the far-off Dedannan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
days, Dectura the queen loved the Green
Harper, and went forth with him and was seen
no more of her own people.”</p>

<p>“If thou indeed wilt have it so, Darthool,
be thou my Dectura, and let me be thy Green
Harper. For beyond the reach of life or death
is the greatness of the love I feel for thee, even
now in this first hour of our meeting.”</p>

<p>“Thy words are in my heart, Nathos; and
because that this is so, I now put <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> upon
thee. Let thy sword be as my sword, and be
thou to me as brother and friend and the
holder of my leal love; and to this end, lo! I
throw this yellow thistle against thy cheek, to
raise a mark of shame there if thou dost not
fulfil the bond, and there to be seen of all men
as a sign and witness of thy disgrace; yea,
even thus I put <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> upon thee, to succour me
in my ill fate, to take me unto thyself, to give
thyself unto me, and to let us go forth together
heedless of Fate.”</p>

<p>Nathos looked at her with proud eyes.</p>

<p>“Of a surety, Darthool, there is no hero of
the Red Branch who hath a courage greater
than thine, even though it may be that thou
speakest the more freely from knowing little of
what may befall.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>“What can befall save death, and dost thou
fear death, son of Usna?”</p>

<p>Nathos smiled out of grave eyes.</p>

<p>“If I feared death, Darthool, I would not
now be speaking with thee here. It is swift
silence upon any who in this forbidden land
speaks with the daughter of Felim the Harper.
Concobar MacNessa has the ears of a hare
and the eyes of a hawk and the swoop of
an eagle. Dost thou remember the swineherd
to whom thou gavest word privily? Well,
that night he lay in the grass tended only by
the raven and the wolf, for he was done to
death with blunt spear-shafts.”</p>

<p>“For that I have deep grief,” said Darthool,
with tears drifting like a rainy mist athwart the
blue of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, he died with a smile, Darthool.
Thou hadst looked into his eyes and
kissed him. Even so, and for less now, would
I too die.”</p>

<p>“That thou shalt not do, Nathos;” and even
as she spoke Darthool moved forward and put
her honeysweet lips against the mouth of
Nathos, and made his blood leap, and a flame
come into his eyes, and a trembling come into
his limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as though with that kiss she had become
as a wild rose, she stood swaying lightly,
her fair face delicately aflame. Nathos put his
arms about her, and kissed her on the brow
and on the lips.</p>

<p>“That kiss on the brow is for service,” he
said, “because from this hour thou art my
queen; and that kiss on the lips is for love, for
from this hour I shall love no woman save thee
thyself, but shall be thine and thine only in life
or death.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though Nathos accepted the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> put upon him by Darthool, he was
troubled at the thought of the anger of
Concobar the high king. It would be a
swift and bitter death for him, and for Darthool
too it might be death or worse.</p>

<p>The thought in his mind swam into his eyes,
and Darthool saw it. She shrank from him,
and stood hesitating and as though about to
flee at his first word of doubt. When he
looked at her again his last fear went.</p>

<p>“Fair wonderful one, thou art as a fawn
there in the fern where thou standest; Darthool,
do not doubt the truth of my words. I
am thine to love and to serve, and am under
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> to thee. But my thought was this: if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
we two go hence and are waylaid, it will be
death, and if we go hence and are not waylaid
forthwith, it will still be death; for long is the
arm, and heavy the hand, and tireless the quest
of Concobar MacNessa. And this, too: that
if we cross the Moyle and go to Alba, it may
still be death; yea, though for a year or for a
brood of years we elude the undying wrath and
vengeance of the king.”</p>

<p>“He will forget when once the bird is flown.
Neither the bird nor the wind leaves any track,
so let our flight be as that of the bird and our
way be as that of the wind.”</p>

<p>“The king forgetteth not. If so be that we
might escape him many years, he will yet have
his will of us in the end; and this though thou
wert old, Darthool, and wert no longer his
desire, and though I were outlawed and broken
and no more in his sight than a wolf of the
hills, good to slay if come upon, but not worthy
of chase.”</p>

<p>“Concobar is not a king in Alba?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go to thine own land. He
can do no more than send emissaries after
us, and with these thou canst deal swiftly,
Nathos.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>At that, Nathos lightly laughed.</p>

<p>“Truly, I am seeing Concobar as a man sees
his own shadow in the water. He is a great
king in Uladh, but he is no more in Alba than
any hero of the Red Branch. Come, Darthool;
across the Moyle are the pine-green shores of
Alba. It is a fair, beautiful land. The sea-lochs
reach far among pine-clad hills, and green
pastures are on the slopes of the great mountains
and around the shadowy, inland waters.
The forests are full of deer and wild birds, the
rivers and lochs of fish, the pastures of cattle
and sheep and swift brown mares. Thou shalt
have milk to drink, and the red flesh of the
salmon, and the brown flesh of the deer, and
the white flesh of the badger. Thou shalt lack
for nothing, who art my queen; and thou shalt
have love till the sun grows a lordlier fire and
the stars leap in their slow dance from dusk to
dawn.”</p>

<p>“I will come,” Darthool whispered, with
glad eyes.</p>

<p>“Only thou must not delay. Thy coming
must be now. Thou must not even enter the
rath again. Otherwise it is never the waters
of the Moyle that we shall see, but only the
red flame in the eyes of Concobar.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Even while Nathos spoke his eyes grew
hard, and his hands slipped to the javelin he
had by his side. While Darthool watched
him in amaze, he swung the iron-pointed shaft
at a place where a bent bracken hung listless
in the air.</p>

<p>“Is it a wolf?” cried Darthool, in sudden
affright.</p>

<p>“It is worse than a wolf,” answered Nathos;
“for if thou wilt go to that place thou wilt
see either a slain man, or the form of a man, in
the grass beneath the bracken.”</p>

<p>Swiftly Darthool ran to the spot wherein the
javelin had swung singing. There was no
one there, but, where the javelin still quivered
slightly, she saw the still warm shape of a
crouching man, and discerned, by the bending
of the bracken, what course he must have
twisted away.</p>

<p>Nathos followed and stood beside her. As
he stooped to pluck the javelin from the ground,
he descried a wooden-hilted knife.</p>

<p>“It is as I thought,” he said gravely.
“Concobar has set a spy upon me. No Ultonian
carries a knife such as this. It belongs
to the hillmen of the north-west, of whom a
few years agone we made slaves. Mayhap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
one of these men who were with the swineherd
has been told to follow me secretly wheresoever
I go.”</p>

<p>Darthool turned and looked at Nathos with
eyes filled with a new fear, because of her love
of him.</p>

<p>He took her hand in his.</p>

<p>“There is yet time, Darthool. Wilt thou
go back to the rath, and stay there till Concobar
wills thee to be his wife?”</p>

<p>“I cannot go back.”</p>

<p>“Then come, O Darthool.”</p>

<p>And with that the twain turned and moved
swiftly northward through the forest, by the
way Nathos had already passed.</p>

<p>“By dawn we may reach the dun where my
two brothers now are, and for that day and
that night we may rest in safety,” whispered
Nathos, as Darthool turned and looked for the
last time upon the place where she had lived
all these years.</p>

<p>“But thereafter, O love that I have won,
the wind must be in our hair and the dead
leaves be upon the soles of our feet, for there
can be no resting for us till we are away from
this land: no, and not for us only, but also
for Ailne and Ardan. Concobar will not rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
content with bitter wrath, and, if he cannot
track the stag, will slay the fawns.”</p>

<p>Soon thereafter they drew near the place
where Nathos had left his hounds and his
huntsmen. Bidding Darthool hide among the
bracken and undergrowth, he went forward
alone and told the men to go back to the dun
of the sons of Usna, but not till the third day,
and by circuitous ways. Thus he hoped that
he might the longer elude Concobar, whose
emissaries would follow the track of his
hounds.</p>

<p>Thereafter Nathos and Darthool fared
swiftly hand in hand through the sombre ways
of the forest. While it was still light they
emerged upon a great moor, which they
crossed, and then ascended the gorges of the
hills. There the night fell, as though a wind-drifted
darkness suddenly suspended and then
swiftly enshrouded everything. They dreaded
to rest, and yet so deep was the darkness that
they could fare no farther.</p>

<p>But while they were still whispering the one
to the other, Darthool descried a soft, silver
shining, like a dewy gossamer. It was the
little group of seven stars that we call the
Pleiades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>“See,” she whispered, “An Grioglachan!
When they shine, others will soon be seen.”
And so it was.</p>

<p>All through the night the fugitives hastened
onward by the light of the stars, ever keeping
close to each other, for the mountain solitudes
were full of dreadful noises, and in the black
tarns among the peaty moss they could hear
the moaning of the kelpie, or on the shores of
the hill-lochs the shrill neighing of the water-horses,
terrible creatures of the darkness.</p>

<p>For the last hour of the dark they rested a
brief while, lying close hid among the bracken,
in a sheltered place on a rocky mountain slope.
Darthool heeded little now the weariness and
fears of that perilous faring by night, for she
was with Nathos; and Nathos now was glad,
and no longer cared whether death was sure
or not. He fell asleep there under the morning
stars, among the winter-brown bracken,
with Darthool’s head upon his breast; and his
last thought was, that if the swineherd had died
smiling because Darthool’s eyes had looked
into his, how well might he too die content
if his hour came suddenly upon him.</p>

<p>The dawn wavered among the hills, but still
they slept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>A wolf tracking a wounded doe howled,
and the howling wailed from corrie to corrie.
Darthool stirred, but slept again. An eagle
screamed as it rose and wheeled against the
broadening light, but its wild voice was
drowned in silence. Then came the first sun-rays
rippling, dancing, leaping, from amid the
crested heights and peaks to the eastward,
and Nathos awoke.</p>

<p>For some moments he lay breathless with
wonder. Darthool, in all her radiant beauty,
was by his side, her golden hair ablaze in the
sunlight, and her fair face like a flower amid
the bracken. It was too great a wonder.
Then he knew that Concobar’s hounds might
any hour now be upon them, and so he put
his dream away from him, and stooped and
kissed Darthool upon the lips. With a cry
she woke, and put her arms about him. Hard
it was for him to add to her weariness; but
she rose at once, and seemed, indeed, in his
eyes, as fresh as any fawn of the hill-side.
She went to a little tarn close by and drank of
the cool, sweet water.</p>

<p>As she drank Nathos looked at her, and
again wondered if she were not one of the
divine race of old, the mysterious Tuatha-De-Danann,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
whom, ages before, the Milesians had
driven to the hills and remote places. So fair
was she that his heart ached. Then a swift
pulse of joy leaped within him, and he was
glad with a great gladness.</p>

<p>Thereafter they sped swiftly onward, and
now Nathos exulted, for he recognised the
peaks and the trend of the valleys. Within
an hour from the rising of the sun he saw the
grey walls of the dun of the sons of Usna.</p>

<p>His long cry&mdash;that of the heron thrice repeated&mdash;brought
Ailne and Ardan forth. Darthool
looked at them wondering, for they, too,
were taller and nobler than other men, and
only less beautiful in her eyes than Nathos
himself.</p>

<p>But if she wondered, much more did they
marvel at what they saw. Never had they
beheld any woman so beautiful, and their first
thought was that of Nathos, that Darthool
was of the fair divine race who were now so
seldom seen of men.</p>

<p>But when Nathos had told them all, and
that she who was now his bride was no other
than that Darthool whom Concobar the high
king had set aside to become his queen, they
were filled with sorrow. Well they knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Concobar MacNessa would not lightly relinquish
the fair maid whom he had so long
secreted in the forest-lios, and that blood would
flow because of this thing.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” said Ailne, “hast thou forgotten
the prophecy? There is the saying of
Cathba the Druid, of which we have all heard:
that from the daughter of Felim the Harper
would come sorrow to the king, and severance
of the Red Branch from the lost kingdom of
Uladh, and rivers of blood.”</p>

<p>“That may be, Ailne, my brother,” Nathos
answered; “but I ask none to go with me
into this doom, if that doom indeed must be,
though mayhap the dark hour of it is passed.
For Darthool and I shall now fare forward,
with some of our following, and with horses
and food, and haply we may reach the coast
and find our great galley in the Creek of the
Willows, where we secreted it, and so gain the
shores of Alba before Concobar can overtake
us.”</p>

<p>But while Ailne pondered, Ardan spoke.</p>

<p>“That shall not be, Nathos. Listen! By
the Sun and the Wind I swear that where
thou goest I will go, and that I will never
desert thee nor Darthool, who is now our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
sister. If the doom must come, let it come.
What is death, that it should put a paleness
into the face of love? Are we not close-kin,
children of one mother, and is not Darthool
thy wife now and our sister, and are we not
henceforth as one? Speak, Ailne, is it not
so?”</p>

<p>“It is so. Ardan has spoken for me. But
I say nothing, for I feel upon us the shadow
of that doom of which, as we have heard,
Cathba the Druid spoke.”</p>

<p>But here Darthool moved forward.</p>

<p>“Listen, Nathos, and ye, Ailne and Ardan,
my brothers: it is not for me to bring sorrow
upon the king and upon the Red Branch and
upon Uladh, and still less upon ye, my brothers,
and upon thee, Nathos. Therefore, let me now
go back to the lios, and tell Lavarcam, who
will tell the king, that I have no will to stray,
and that I will abide in that place till I die, or
till Concobar dare put his face against Fate
and take me thence.”</p>

<p>At that Nathos smiled only. There was no
word to say; in his eyes was all his answer to
Darthool.</p>

<p>But Ardan answered for himself and Ailne:</p>

<p>“Though the stars fall, beautiful daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of Felim, who art now Darthool, our sister, we
shall not leave thee, nor suffer thee to go from
us save by thine own free will, and that in
no fear for what may befall us. Nathos and
Ailne and Ardan are the three sons of Usna,
upon whom long ago <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> was set, that each
would abide by each until death.”</p>

<p>Thereupon all kissed each other, and took
the deep vow of fealty. The sons of Usna
knew well that it would be a madness to withstand
Concobar in their dun, strong as it was;
for in time he would take the place, as dogs
hunt out the badger from its lair, and at the
best would still starve them into surrender or
death.</p>

<p>So with all speed they summoned those of
their following who were under the sword-bond,
and put together food and raiment, and
then mounted and rode swiftly away.</p>

<p>As they passed the highest ridge to the
eastward that night they looked back. A red
light flared in a valley far to the west. It was
their dun, a torch amid the darkness. A single
column of flame rose above it, and wavered to
and fro. And by that sign they knew that
the long arm and the heavy hand of Concobar
MacNessa had already reached out towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
them. Three times fifty men went with them,
and so swift was their flight and so sure their
way that before long they came to the coast-lands.
There, in the Creek of the Willows,
the long black galley was found; and swiftly
all embarked.</p>

<p>It was with glad eyes that Darthool and
the sons of Usna saw the dancing waves of
the sea, and felt its free breath break upon
them. From three great tiers, fifty score men
to each, the vassals thrust out their long oars,
and with their blades threshed the waters into
a yeast of foam. In the dazzle of the sea
Darthool rejoiced, and made the hearts of all
there to swell because of an exceeding sweet
song she sang.</p>

<p>Nathos and Ailne and Ardan sat beside
her, and could scarce take from her face their
dreaming eyes.</p>

<p>Towards noon the wind shifted, and slid out
of the north towards the west. Then the
great sail was hoisted, and bellied out to the
steady breeze, and the oars were shipped.
The black galley now flew along the waters
like a cormorant. Darthool laughed with joy
at this new beautiful world of the sea, and
never tired of trailing her hands in the swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
lapsing wave, or in the send of the following
billow.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they came close to the
shores of Alba, and made northward, past
many isles and through narrow straits and
fjords. In one and all Darthool took pleasure,
and was glad indeed that the land of Nathos
was so beautiful.</p>

<p>At sundown they reached the eastern shores
of the great island of Mull, and there the wind
failed them, so the galley was put into a bay
that is now the bay of Aros.</p>

<p>There the sons of Usna debated long as
to what course to follow. Nathos and Ailne
thought it best to move inland, and to gain
the protection of the high king of Alba; but
Darthool feared this because of a dream she
had thrice dreamed, wherein she saw a strange
king and a strange folk laughing over the slain
body of Nathos, while she stood by crowned
but a captive. As for Ardan, he said only
that the sons of Usna should go to where
their father’s dun had been, before the last king
of Alba had destroyed it.</p>

<p>That night a galley came to them from the
long island of Lismore. In it were a score of
men, commanded by a lord of Appin, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Fergus of the Three Duns. With him was a
stranger, clad in a rich robe of fur, so claspt
across the throat with gold that the hood he
wore fell about and covered his face. While
Fergus spake with the sons of Usna, and
told them how they had been seen by men of
his in a swift war-galley, off the south coast
of Mull, and urged them also to go inland to
meet the king, the stranger looked steadfastly
upon Darthool.</p>

<p>When at last he had to speak to the brothers
he addressed them courteously, but in a Gaelic
strange to their ears. He bade them come
with him to his high-walled dun, a brief way
inland: to come alone, as his guests, and to
bring Darthool with them.</p>

<p>“It is not well to go to a man’s dun, and
not be knowing that man’s name,” said Nathos
courteously.</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated, and looked at
Fergus.</p>

<p>“They call me Angus Mudartach,” he said.
But at that Darthool asked him to let her look
upon his face.</p>

<p>“For it is not meet,” she added, “that we
should go to a man’s dun and not have seen
his face.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>Angus of Moidart drew back his hood.</p>

<p>Darthool’s lips grew pale. Then she
smiled.</p>

<p>“Let us rest here for to-night, Angus
Mudartach,” she said, “and, if thou wilt come
again on the morrow after to-morrow, thou
canst take us with thee to thy great dun. But
meanwhile we have travelled far and swiftly,
and would fain rest: and, as thou seest, the
skies are clear, and we want for nothing.”</p>

<p>Once more Angus pleaded to the sons of
Usna.</p>

<p>“Ye are brave men, and can laugh at weariness
or danger. But if the island be swept
by a great storm to-night, or if the followers of
Concobar, king of the northlands of Erin,
come upon ye, or if other misadventure befall,
shall ye wantonly expose this fair young
princess? Nay, rather, let her come with
me, and she shall not only be safe in my great
rath of Dunchraig, but there my wife and
her maidens shall make much of her, and give
her white robes and golden torques and garments
of delicate furs. This maid whom ye
call Darthool is too young to be thrown thus
idly before the feet of the evil powers who are
for ever clamouring for death.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>But, at a sign from Darthool, Nathos refused;
saying, with gracious words and courteous
mien, that it would rejoice them all to visit
Angus Mudartach later, but not then.</p>

<p>So Angus of Moidart turned, frowning, and
went back to his galley with Fergus of the
Three Duns. And as he went he asked
mutteringly how many men the sons of Usna
had with them. When he learned that there
were thrice fifty, and that Fergus had but a
score and ten men with him, he said no more.</p>

<p>When the strangers had gone, Nathos
turned to Darthool and asked why she had
not shown more graciousness to one who was
surely a great lord among the Alban Gaels,
and why she would not go with him.</p>

<p>“Because, Nathos, that man who called
himself Angus Mudartach is no other than the
King of Alba. He it is whom I saw in my
dreams, laughing over your slain body, and
beside whom I stood crowned and yet a captive.
And by that token I warn ye of this
thing: that the Alban king desireth me, and
would fain slay ye all, or deliver ye into the
hands of Concobar MacNessa.”</p>

<p>Nathos stood brooding, but Ardan stepped
forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>“Darthool is right. And wise she was, too,
to bid this Angus of Moidart come on the
morrow after to-morrow. Nevertheless, I
know well by hearsay of his vassal, Fergus
of the Three Duns, and that the man is called
Fergus the Wily. He will not wait, but at
dawn will be about us, with thrice fifty and
thrice fifty again.”</p>

<p>“Ardan has spoken well,” added Nathos.
“There is but one thing to be done. Weary
we are, but we must go hence at once.”</p>

<p>And so it was. The dusk was heavy upon
sea and land that night, and a sea-mist came
up and obscured the skies, so that not a star
was visible.</p>

<p>Soundlessly they launched the great galley
again, and once more set sail. The night-wind
was from the south-east, whereat they
rejoiced, for thus there was no need of the
oars, and so no betraying thresh would be
heard.</p>

<p>When they were well north of Lismore they
put out the long oars and swung the galley
northwards. It was with relief that the sons
of Usna passed the Appin lands, and before
dawn rowed into a great sea-loch.</p>

<p>There, however, they learned that the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
of Alba, he who had called himself Angus
Mudartach, was in the westlands only for a
brief while, and would have to haste to Dunedin
straightway, as runners had come with
tidings of a great rising. He had no rath of
Dunchraig, and no dun there; and so in truth
the sons of Usna knew that the king had
lied to them, and that Darthool was right. As
for Fergus of the Three Duns, he was no
longer a great lord, but had been despoiled,
and at the most could summon two score and
ten men.</p>

<p>So the sons of Usna greatly rejoiced, for
now they could go to their own land in safety,
which lay beyond the region held by Fergus
of the Duns.</p>

<p>For seven days they stayed by the shores
of that sea-loch, under the shadow of mighty
mountains. Ardan, with a scanty following,
went through the hill-passes, and returned
saying that the King of Alba had gone to his
own country and that all the great lords of
the region had departed with him, including
Fergus.</p>

<p>So on the eighth day the galley sailed a
short way southward once more, and entered
into the Bay of Selma. There, on a rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
eminence, were the walls of their great dun,
which Usna their father had built among the
ruins of the chief stronghold of the Cruithne,
the ancient people of Alba.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>It was with joy that the sons of Usna saw
once more the house of their childhood, and
with still greater joy that they found the people
of the neighbouring glens and straths still loyal
to them. Their father Usna had ever been
at war with the King of Alba, and after many
battles (the bards sang of the beauty of Usna’s
wife as the torch that lit those wars) he had
conquered all this region. But at his death,
by treachery the king had overcome the
stronghold and destroyed it.</p>

<p>But now again the sons of Usna had their
home in their own eyrie. They knew not how
long they might abide there in peace, for either
the King of Alba, or Fergus of the Duns as
his leader of men, would come again when
once peace in the eastlands was secured.</p>

<p>There Nathos wished to dwell alone with
Darthool and a few followers, but Ailne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Ardan once more refused to leave him then
or ever. But glad were the thrice fifty vassals
to return to their own land, and without regret
the sons of Usna saw them set sail for Erin.
They were men who cared little for aught
save strife, and when not wielding sword or
spear were haughty and bitter with all other
men save those of the Red Branch, and so
were only a danger and a weariness in that
place.</p>

<p>Throughout that winter they lived there in
peace, hunting and fishing. So great was the
love of each for Darthool that every day was
full of peace and content wherein they saw
her. Nathos moved in a dream, and knew
the extreme of joy. At night, before the fire,
Darthool sang to them old-world airs of a
sweet plaintive music, so sweet and plaintive
that men said she must be no other than
Fionula, she of the children of Lir who were
turned into wild swans, and lived a thousand
years in the old, old days.</p>

<p>But when spring came again&mdash;a spring so
fair and sweet that it was as though May had
come hand in hand with February&mdash;a rumour
reached them that the King of Alba, though
he could not penetrate the highlands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
west, intended, with the help of Fergus of the
Duns and other chieftains, to proceed once
more against the Dun of Usna. Moreover,
he had sworn to raze it to the ground, and to
slay Nathos, and to take Darthool to be his
wife.</p>

<p>Nathos laughed at this, for he knew well
that the King of Alba would never take him
alive, nor yet Darthool. But after long colloquy
with Ailne and Ardan, all decided to set
forth and pass northward to the land whence
their mother had come, a land of endless mountains
and narrow lochs, beautiful beyond any
other, grander than any Darthool had seen,
and remote beyond the reach of any Alban
king.</p>

<p>So thither they set forth, and took with them
in their great galley two score and ten men
of their own clan. After long sailing up
narrow lochs, the sons of Usna reached the
mountain land whence their mother had come.
Her father was dead, but the great dun he
had built upon the summit of one of the hills
overlooking the Black Loch had been left unharmed,
and was tenanted only by wandering
shepherds. Here Nathos and Darthool made
their home, and in that beautiful land and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the glory of spring, knew the full joy and
richness of life.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>For a brief while all the people of the
mountain lands round about gave in their adherence
to Nathos, so that he became as a
king in that region. So great was the fear in
which the three sons of Usna were held, and
so strong were they in their mountain home,
that none dared to approach them with the
flaming brand.</p>

<p>Thus three years passed, and in all the wide
reaches of the world there was no man so
happy as Nathos and no woman so happy as
Darthool; and after these there were none so
happy as Ailne and Ardan, who were well
content to live so that they might be near the
beautiful wife of Nathos, their sister, Darthool,
fairest of all women in the world.</p>

<p>The King of Alba, whom they had feared,
was now dead, and the king who reigned in
his place was well disposed towards the sons
of Usna and sought their alliance. So this
was done, and the name and fame of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
brothers spread throughout the land; while
from the wild west to the populous east the
poets sang of the beauty of Darthool.</p>

<p>In the summer months they abode at the
high fort of Darthool, for so they named it,
on the heights above the Black Loch, or Loch
Ness as we now call it; and from the first
frosts till the cuckoo’s song had ceased they
lived at Dunuisneachan, their father’s ancient
stronghold by the shores of Loch Etive.
Thence often they wandered far afoot, or sailed
southward and eastward among the sea-lochs
and narrow kyles. They hunted in Glenorchy
and fished under the mountain-shadows on
Loch Awe; or followed the deer through the
woods of Glenlaidhe. When it was pleasant to
be upon the waters, they sailed down the long
fjord of Loch Fyne, and rested awhile at the
Haven of the Foray, and watched the coming
and going of the rainbows on the rocky headlands
which guard that place; then they would
cross to the Cowal, and enter the narrow Kyles
of Bute, where on the little isle we call the
Burnt Island they built a vitrified fort. Thence
they followed past the Hills of Ruel to Glendaruay
(Glendaruel), and so to the head of
Loch Striven and up Glenmassan, and thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
down by the sweet inland waters of Loch
Eck, and waterward again by the bay we now
call the Holy Loch. Thence up the long,
narrow fjord of Loch Long they sailed, till
among the mountains they crossed the short
pass to Loch Lomond, and perhaps met the
soldiery of the King of Alba at the inland
lakes, or came upon the great fort of Dumbarton
on the Clyde; or they may have crossed
the hill to the Gareloch, and so returned westward
once more by the blue frith of Clyde,
past the precipitous isle of Arran, and so up
Loch Fyne again; or seaward by the Mull of
Cantire, and thence northward past the isles
to their own place, and could once more watch
the salmon leaping through the Falls of Lora
or chase the deer on the hills of Etive.</p>

<p>But during all this time Concobar, the high
king of the Ultonians, nursed his bitter
thoughts. He had heard of the great fame
and happiness of the sons of Usna, and more
than ever he yearned after Darthool, his wrath
at his loss being the greater because that all
the old prophecies about the beautiful daughter
of Felim were unfulfilled.</p>

<p>One day the high king made a great festival
in Emain Macha, and never in Erin was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
one more royal and magnificent. The princes
and nobles from all the regions in the sway
of Concobar were there, and all the musicians,
singers, and poets in Uladh.</p>

<p>In the midst of the festival Concobar asked
those present at his board if now, in the height
of the glory of the Red Branch, they wanted
for anything; but they answered as with one
voice that they were content.</p>

<p>“And that is what I am not,” he answered.</p>

<p>“And wherefore, O king and lord?”</p>

<p>“Because that the three greatest of ye are
absent from us. I speak of the three Torches
of the Valour of the Gael: Nathos and Ailne
and Ardan, the sons of Usna, the son of
Congal Claringnech. For now I the king say
this: that it is not fitting these three heroes,
the pride of our chivalry, should be in exile,
and this only because of a woman. By the
Sun and Wind, there is no woman alive who is
worthy to be the cause of this. Far better
were it that the sons of Usna were once more
in our midst. Even now they hold half the
lands of Alba under the shadow of their sword.
Truly they are heroes, and if dark days come
upon us, as the soothsayers foretell, then indeed
we shall be in sore need of them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>All there were rejoiced at that. There was
not one who had not lamented the fierce
anger of Concobar, and who was not fain to
have the sons of Usna again among the
chivalry of the Red Branch. Only fear had
not allowed them to speak, for the high king
had slain a man who had said that Nathos was
too great a lord to be exiled.</p>

<p>“And since ye are so glad at this thing,”
Concobar added, “and would fain have these
heroes among us, to be the chief pride, glory
and defence of Uladh against all other
kingdoms and provinces of Erin, I say to ye:
Go and bring hence again from Alba the three
sons of Usna.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” their spokesman answered;
“but who is to prevail with Nathos and
his brothers? We are willing to go, but
we cannot bring Nathos against his will.
Moreover, is he not under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> not to put foot
again in Erin?”</p>

<p>“Not so. I know that Nathos is under
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> not to return to Erin unless it be in the
company of Fergus, the son of Lossa the
Red, or Conall Cernach, or Cuchulain. And
look you, each of these is now here, so that
I shall well know who most loves me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>So, when the feast was over, Concobar first
drew Conall Cernach aside.</p>

<p>“Tell me, O warrior lord,” he said, “what
wouldst thou say or do if I should send thee
for the sons of Usna, and that at my secret
command they should be slain privily&mdash;a
thing, nevertheless, Conall, which I do not
purpose to do.”</p>

<p>“That could not be done, O king and lord,
without a bitter and wrongful bloodshedding,
for I could not do otherwise than put death
upon each and all of the Ultonians who might
be with me on that day.”</p>

<p>“That may be so, Conall Cernach. So now,
go.”</p>

<p>Thereafter the king sent for Cuchulain.
The young champion came to him fearlessly,
for the whole heart of the warrior prince was
noble and courageous.</p>

<p>Concobar asked him the same question as he
had asked Conall Cernach.</p>

<p>“What would I do, O lord and king?”
answered Cuchulain with proud disdain. “This
thing I would do, and my troth to it: that if
thou through me brought about the death
of the sons of Usna, thou mightst flee eastward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
to Innia Iarrtharaigh<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> itself, and yet
not be safe from perishing by my hand because
of thy deed.”</p>

<p>Concobar smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I knew well, Cuchulain, that ye bore me
no love,” he said; and bade the hero begone.</p>

<p>Thereafter the king sent for Fergus, the
son of Rossa, and to him he put the same
question as to Conall Cernach and to Cuchulain.</p>

<p>“This much I say,” said Fergus, “that
never would I raise hand or weapon against
thee: nevertheless, there is not one Ultonian
who might fare forth on that errand who
would not get the shortness of life and sorrow
of death from me.”</p>

<p>“It is thou, Fergus, son of Rossa, who dost
truly love thy king. It is to thee I entrust
this thing, who shalt be greater in Erin than
any son of Usna. Go forth on the morrow,
and remember thy name of old&mdash;Fergus
Honeymouth. Of a surety Nathos, with
Darthool, and Ailne and Ardan, shall come
from Alba with thee. When thou art again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
in Erin, go at once to the house of Borrach,
the son of Cainte; and when thou art there
stay, because of one of thy <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geasa</i> never to
refuse a feast, and beforehand I shall warn
Borrach of this thing. Then send forward
at once, and without covenant, and without
protection, to Emain Macha, the three sons of
Usna.”</p>

<p>So on the morrow Fergus went forth, taking
none with him save his two sons, Illann the
Fair, and Buine of the Red Locks, and a
man Cullen to steer the sea-barge wherewith
he would set sail.</p>

<p>It was a fair voyage, and soon the black
barge of Fergus sailed past the isles and
headlands of Alba, and came to Loch Etive
and the Bay of Selma, where the great fort
of Dun Usneachain lay black against the ivy-clad
heights beyond.</p>

<p>This was in the first heats of summer, and
Nathos and Darthool, with Ailne and Ardan,
had left the fort and were among the rocky
declivities of the woodland near the sea.
There they had three hunting booths: one
for Nathos and Darthool, one for Ailne and
Ardan, and one wherein to have their eating
and drinking. In front of one of these booths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Nathos and Darthool sat, on that day of the
days, playing on the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cemrcaem</i> (the chessboard),
the very <a id="chessboard" href="#chess_board"></a>chessboard which had belonged
to Concobar, but which the king had
left in the dun of Ailne and Ardan when hunting
near by, on the day before that on which
they fled with Nathos. It was all of ivory,
and the chessmen were of wrought gold and in
the likeness of strange kings and priests and
fantastic animals wrought in immemorial years
in the Orient.</p>

<p>And while they were playing a great shout
was heard, coming upon them from a branch-hid
hollow of the sea.</p>

<p>“That is the voice of a man of Erin,” said
Nathos, holding in the air a golden knight.</p>

<p>“Not so,” answered Darthool; “it is the
voice of a Gael of Alba.” Yet well she knew
that Nathos had guessed aright, and that even
now were the footsteps of fate drawing close.
For none can prevail against destiny.</p>

<p>Once more a loud cry was heard, and a voice
called upon Nathos and the sons of Usna.</p>

<p>“Of a surety, that is the voice of a man
of Erin,” said Nathos eagerly, for his heart
was fain to see an Ultonian again, and to
hear of the Red Branch and of the fate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Uladh, and as to whether Concobar reigned
still.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is not so,” answered Darthool,
and turning the great glory and beauty of
her eyes upon Nathos she bade him play on.
Then a third cry, nearer and clearer, was
heard; and now all knew that it was the voice
of a man of Erin.</p>

<p>“And if there be no cloud upon me,” said
Nathos, “that is the voice of no other than
Fergus, the son of Rossa the Red, whom I
knew well of old, and for whom my heart is
fain. Ardan, do ye go down at once to the
haven, and bid Fergus welcome, and all who
may be with him. It is a good day this for
us, when once more we may hear the voices
of the Red Branch.”</p>

<p>While Ardan went to the haven, Darthool
told Nathos she had known from the first
that the newcomer was a man out of Erin, and
moreover, that he came from Concobar, and
that his coming boded no good.</p>

<p>“And how will you be knowing the one and
the other, Darthool?”</p>

<p>“From a dream that I had: to wit, that
three birds flew hither from Emain Macha,
and brought with them three sips of rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
honey, and then that they left us with that
honey but took away instead three sips of our
blood.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, my queen, what is the reading
you put upon that dream?”</p>

<p>“That Fergus comes to us with the honey-words
of peace, but that behind them lies the
shedding of blood, and that blood ours.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ardan welcomed Fergus, and
brought him and his companions to where
Nathos sat playing with Darthool upon the
ivory and gold chessboard of Concobar the
king. As the fair-smiling Ultonian drew
near, he smiled a grimmer smile behind his
beard, to see Nathos there with the two
chiefest treasures of the king’s heart&mdash;the
woman he wished to make his queen, and the
chessboard that had come to him from some
great king’s palace in the dim remote Indies
of which the poets sang.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing, and Nathos and his
brothers and Darthool embraced Fergus and
his sons, and eagerly questioned them for
tidings.</p>

<p>“The best tidings I have,” Fergus answered,
“is that I have come to ye with messages
of loving peace from Concobar, whose heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
is smitten by your long absence, and who
would fain see in Erin again the three noblest
lords in his or any other realm. Moreover,
he has sent me to you with covenants and
guarantees of loving good faith. He has
pledged his kingly word, and I, too, have
pledged mine, and ye know well, ye sons
of Usna, that Fergus MacRossa Rua is not
a man of light word. So come back to
Erin with me, Nathos and Ailne and Ardan,
and I pray of thee, come thou too, Darthool,
wife of Nathos. Great shall be the welcome
given to ye all, and sure it is a good thing
to end a feud, and to put an unwaking sleep
upon the sword and the spear.”</p>

<p>“That is a good word,” said Nathos, who
was well pleased; but a sob was in the heart
of Darthool, and her lips quivered as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Surely,” she said, “Concobar MacNessa
forgets. The sons of Usna are no tributaries.
Nathos is overlord now of a country greater
in extent than all the province of Uladh over
which Concobar is king. It ill befits a king
of an isle to go as a forgiven guest to the lord
of a rock.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Fergus quickly, “Darthool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
has justice for what she says. But there
is truth in what I say also, and it is a truth
which the sons of Usna know, and will act by,
that a man longs to see the land which is
his own land or the land of his adoption. And
were not Nathos and Ailne and Ardan among
us as children and as boys and as youths,
and are they not heroes of the Red Branch?
Surely, it is a good thing for a man to see his
own land each day, and to rejoice therein?”</p>

<p>“We have two lands,” interrupted Ardan,
“we who are of both Alba and Erin. Nevertheless,
it would ill befit us not to look upon
ourselves of the Red Branch first and foremost.
So if Nathos is ready to go with thee,
so also are Ailne and I myself.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Nathos, though he kept
his eyes away from those of Darthool.</p>

<p>“And ye know that my guaranty is sure?”
added Fergus.</p>

<p>“It is sure,” said Nathos.</p>

<p>That night all were full of joyous pleasure,
save only Darthool, who in her heart knew
that the shadowy feet of Fate were all about
them, and that she at least and perhaps none
other there would ever again see Alba.</p>

<p>On the morrow all set sail. As they left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
the beautiful shores, than which for sure there
are none more beautiful in all the realms
of the Gael, Darthool took her harp and sat
back among the deerskins in the stern of the
galley and sang:</p>

<p>Nathos was sad when he heard this lament
from the mouth of Darthool, and Ailne and
Ardan looked at each other and whispered
that it was the beginning of the end. Nevertheless,
they did not fear to confront the days
to come, for whatsoever the decrees of Fate
may be a brave man does not draw back, but
goes forward upon the way set before him.
But Nathos was in a dream, and so heeded
little, content too to chide Darthool because
that she laid so much stress on vain imaginings.</p>

<p>The voyage was a swift and good one, and
even Darthool’s heart beat the quicker when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
once more she stood on the soil of Erin, her
own land. In three days thereafter they came
within sight of the Dun of Borrach, and Fergus
MacRossa was glad, for soon he would
be able to see Concobar the king, and tell him
how great was his success.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing that a man such as
Fergus Honeymouth could be so blind. Yet
had he ever believed in the kinglihood of Concobar,
and it was not till he reached the house
of the son of Cainte that he knew in truth
how the high king meant to play him false,
and mayhap to deal treacherously with the
sons of Usna. For after Borrach had greeted
them all with affection and heartsome pleasure,
he told them that word had come from Concobar
that they were to press forward without
delay, so great was the king’s longing to see
them again, and so deep was his love for three
of the noblest of the knights of the Red
Branch. “But upon thee, Fergus MacRossa,
I have a feast made ready, a festival of weeks,
and thou knowest it is <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> upon thee not
to refuse any feast made for thee: and so
as thou wouldst avoid putting shame upon me
and deep disgrace upon thyself, thou must
abide here with me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>At that, Fergus flushed a deep red,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and
was filled with anger. Yet could he not refuse,
for his <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i> was sacred: and no man of
that age dared break that bond.</p>

<p>So he turned to those with him, and asked
what was now to be done.</p>

<p>“Let this be done,” said Darthool: “either
forsake the sons of Usna, or keep to thy feast-bond.”</p>

<p>“My feast-bond I must keep, Darthool, yet
will I not forsake the sons of Usna. My
guaranty is known for sure: but over and
above that I will send with them, and with
thee, my two sons, Illann the Fair and Buine
the Fiery, as further warranty.”</p>

<p>But at these words Nathos turned away
with a scornful smile.</p>

<p>“It is not at thee or thy feast-bond I smile,
O Fergus,” he said, “but at thy protection,
good though thy sons be. For, by the Sun
and Wind, I have never yet had need of any
man to protect me, and go now, as ever before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
confident in my own valour and might: and
this I say not boastingly, but openly, so that
Concobar and all Uladh may know it.”</p>

<p>Thereafter Darthool and the sons of Usna
left the house of Borrach, and fared southward,
with Illann the Fair and Buine in their company.
As for Fergus, he cursed his bond, but nevertheless
assured himself, for, as he said over
and over, if the whole five provinces of Erin
were assembled on one spot, they would not
be able to break the solemn pledge of his
guaranty.</p>

<p>But on the way Darthool urged advice upon
Nathos and his brothers.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” she said, “to the isle of
Cullen, between Erin and Alba, and there
await the day when Fergus will fulfil his
bond. In that way he shall still keep the
obligation of his <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i>, and yet we shall escape
the evil that I know well awaiteth us.”</p>

<p>“That we cannot do,” answered the sons
of Usna, “for we are in honour bound now
to the king. Moreover, we have the guaranty
of Fergus MacRossa.”</p>

<p>“It was an ill day when we came here
trusting to that word,” Darthool replied: but
said no more then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>At dusk they reached the White Cairn on
Sliav-Fuad, and it was not till after they had
left the watch-tower behind them that Nathos
saw that Darthool was no longer of their
company. So he retraced his way, and came
upon her sleeping a deep sleep, though she
awoke suddenly as he drew near.</p>

<p>“Is sleep so heavy upon thee, fair queen?”
he asked, when he saw her startled eyes and
pale face.</p>

<p>“I was weary, Nathos. Yet it is not
weariness that has done this, but a dream.
I dreamed a terrifying and dreadful thing.
I saw thee and Ailne and Ardan and Illann
the Fair, but on not one of these was the
head remaining, but only on Buine the
Fiery.”</p>

<p>“And what will be the meaning of that,
Darthool?”</p>

<p>“That Buine will leave ye ere death
comes, and that a bloody death will be
upon each. Nathos, I pray of thee that thou
wilt go straightway to Dun Delgan, where
the great and noble lord Cuchulain is, and
abide with him for a while. There we shall
be safe. Listen, I pray thee: I see thine
own shadow creeping up thee, and a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
cloud overhead, and a cloud of clotted blood
it is by the same token.”</p>

<p>“Fair woman, there is some guile upon thy
delicate thin lips. Why shouldst thou see
evil everywhere? Be assured that neither I
nor Ailne nor Ardan will turn aside from
our quest of Concobar the king.”</p>

<p>Darthool sighed, and remembered some
old wisdom she had heard from Lavarcam:
that if misfortune will not come to a man
swiftly, he will seek it and take it by the
great boar-fangs and compel it to come against
him.</p>

<p>But on the morrow, as they came within
sight of Emain Macha, once more she gave
counsel.</p>

<p>“Ye know well, Nathos and Ailne and
Ardan, that in Emain Macha are three fair
great houses of the king: that in one he
himself is, with the nobles of Uladh who are
his own following, and that in another are
the wayfarers of the Red Branch, and that
in a third are the women. Now I warn ye
of this thing: that if Concobar welcome us
into his own house and among the nobles of
Uladh, all will be well: but that if he send
us to the house of the Red Branch, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
will mean a disastrous end to thee and to
me.”</p>

<p>They said nothing to that, and when they
came late into Emain Macha they knocked
at the gates of Concobar’s house.</p>

<p>The messengers told the king that the sons
of Usna, and Darthool, and the two sons of
Fergus MacRossa, were without: whereupon
he asked of those about him in what state
of provision and comfort was the house of the
Red Branch, and on hearing that there was
abundance of food and drink and comfort, he
bade the messengers return and conduct the
newcomers to that place.</p>

<p>When that message was given, Darthool
again gave counsel: but Illann the Fair was
wroth thereat, and the others yielded. As for
Nathos, he said only:</p>

<p>“Great is thy love, Darthool, queen of women:
but great also is thy fearfulness.”</p>

<p>At that Darthool smiled gravely, but said
no more. Only in her heart she remembered
what Lavarcam, in bitter irony, had told her
once, that when a man foresaw evil and fore-fended
it he was wise and strong in his courage,
but that if a woman did the same she was
timorous and whim-borne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>In the house of the Red Branch the strangers
were rendered all honour. Generous and
pleasant foods and bitter cheering drinks were
supplied to them, so that the whole company
was joyful and merry, save the sons of Usna,
and Darthool, who were weary with their
journeying.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Thus after they had eaten and drunken,
Nathos and Darthool lay down upon high
couches of white and dappled fawn-skins, and
played upon the gold and ivory chessboard.</p>

<p>It was at this time that a secret messenger
came from Concobar to tell him if Darthool
were as beautiful as when she fled from Erin.
This messenger was no other than Lavarcam.
The woman embraced Darthool tenderly, and
kissed the hands and brow of Nathos. Then,
looking upon them through her tears, she
said:</p>

<p>“Of a surety it is not well for ye twain to
be playing thus upon the second dearest thing
in all the world to Concobar, Darthool being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the dearest, and ye having taken both from
him, Nathos, and now ye twain being in his
house and in his power. And this I tell you
now, that I am sent hither by Concobar to see
if Darthool has her form and beauty as it was
of old. Thy beauty then was a flame before
his eyes, Darthool, and now it will be as a
torch at his heart.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Darthool thrust the chessboard
from her.</p>

<p>“I have the sight upon me,” she said in a
strange voice with a sob in it.</p>

<p>“And what is that sight, my queen?” asked
Nathos.</p>

<p>“I see three torches quenched this night.
And these three torches are the three Torches
of Valour among the Gael, and their names
are the names of the sons of Usna. And more
bitter still is this sorrow, because that the Red
Branch shall ultimately perish through it, and
Uladh itself be overthrown, and blood fall this
way and that as the whirled rains of winter.”</p>

<p>Then taking the small harp by her side, she
struck the strings and sang:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">A bitter, bitter deed shall be done in Emain to-night,</div>
   <div class="verse">And for ages men will speak of the fratricidal fight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></div>
   <div class="verse indent2">And because of the evil done, and the troth unsaid,</div>

   <div class="verse">And left on the threshold of peace silent and cold and dead.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">The three best, fairest, and noblest of any name,</div>

   <div class="verse">And that I, and I only, bore the heavy crown of shame.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>At that Nathos was silent awhile. He knew
now that Darthool was right. He looked at
his brothers: Ailne frowned against the floor,
Ardan stared at the door, with a proud and
perilous smile. He looked at Illann the Fair
and at Buine the Fiery: Buine drank heavily
from a horn of ale, with sidelong eyes, Illann
muttered between his set teeth.</p>

<p>“This only I will say, Darthool,” Nathos
uttered at last, “that it were better to die for
thee, because of thy deathless beauty, than to
live for aught else. As for what else may
betide, what has to be will be.”</p>

<p>“I will go now,” said Lavarcam, “for Concobar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
awaits me. But, sons of Usna and sons
of Fergus, see ye that the doors and windows
be closed, and if Concobar come against ye
treacherously may ye win victory, and that with
life to ye all.”</p>

<p>With that Lavarcam left. Swiftly she
sought Concobar, and told the king that it was
for joy she knew now that the three heroes,
the sons of Usna, had come back to Erin to
dwell in fellowship with the Ardree and the
Red Branch, but that it was for sorrow she had
to tell that Darthool the Beautiful was no longer
fair and comely in form and face, but had lost
her exceeding loveliness, and was now no more
than any other woman.</p>

<p>At first Concobar laughed at that; then as
his jealousy waned he thought with sorrow of
the loss of so great beauty; and then again his
spirit was perturbed. So he sent yet another
messenger on the same errand.</p>

<p>This was a man named Treandhorn. Before
Concobar sent him to the house of the Red
Branch he said:</p>

<p>“Treandhorn, who was it that slew thy father
and thy brother?”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest, O King, that it was Nathos,
son of Usna, who slew them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>Concobar smiled. “Now,” he said, “go and
do my behest.”</p>

<p>When Treandhorn reached the house, he
found all the doors and windows closed and
barred. Then fear seized him, for he knew
that the sons of Usna were on guard, and
would have wrath upon them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, still more did he fear to go
back to Concobar with nought to tell him.</p>

<p>So the man, descrying a narrow window at
one side, climbed to it from an unyoked chariot
that was near, and looked in. He saw Nathos
and Darthool talking each to each in low
voices, where they lay upon the white and
dappled fawn-skins, with the gold and ivory
chessboard between them. He smiled grimly,
when he saw how great and noble and kingly
Nathos seemed, and how more wonderful and
beautiful than ever were the wonder and beauty
of the eyes and face and form of Darthool.</p>

<p>It was the last time he smiled. At that
moment Nathos glanced upward. Swift as
thought he lifted a spiked and barbed chessman
and hurled it at the man’s eye. Treandhorn
fell backward, but rose at once and fled,
with his right eye torn and blind for evermore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>When he came to the king and told his tale,
and how Nathos was like a king indeed, and
Darthool more beautiful by far than she had
been of old, Concobar sprang to his feet. A
red light came into his eyes, and he threw back
his head and laughed; and at that laughing
every man there knew that his madness was
come upon him, and that the blood-thirst was
already sweating upon many swords.</p>

<p>“Ultonians,” he cried, “will ye do the will
of your king?”</p>

<p>“That will we!” they answered with a great
shout.</p>

<p>“Then come ye, and all your followers and
vassals, and surround the house of the Red
Branch, and set it in a forest of red flames,
and if any run from out thereof put them to
the sword.” As all ran swiftly from the king’s
fort, a high terrible voice was heard. It was
that of the dying Cathba the ancient Druid,
and what he cried thrice was: “The Red
Branch perisheth! Uladh passeth! Uladh
passeth!”</p>

<p>But none heard him or paid heed, save only
Lavarcam, who in that bitter crying knew well
that the end was come.</p>

<p>In a brief while thrice three hundred men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
surrounded the fort of the Red Branch, and
set red flames about it; and thrice three
hundred more made haste to join them.</p>

<p>There was a mighty onset at the first led by
Buine the Fiery, who slew many, and quenched
the fires, and threw the Ultonians into confusion.</p>

<p>“Who is the hero who has done this?” cried
Concobar.</p>

<p>“It is I, Buine Borbruay, the son of Fergus
MacRossa.”</p>

<p>“I will give thee great bribes, Buine, if
thou wilt forsake these robbers of my wife that
was to be.”</p>

<p>“What are thy bribes?”</p>

<p>“I will give thee a cantred of land at thine
own choice, and I will make thee my chosen
comrade, and thou shalt be as next to the
king.”</p>

<p>Then Buine the Faithless laughed and said:
“Better the honours of a king than the thanks
of dead men,” and with that, for all the pledged
guaranty of Fergus and the troth of his own
word, he went over unto Concobar.</p>

<p>But when Illann the Fair heard of this he
was wroth. He saw the bitter smile on the
lips of Darthool, and he swore that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
not desert those upon whom lay the protection
of his father’s guaranty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ardan lay, dreaming with a proud
smile against the fire; and, upon the deerskins
near the couch of Darthool, Ailne and Nathos
played at chess, for little did they care to
heed the treacherous valour of the Ultonians.
They knew, too, that their hour was come; and
being kingly, gave no thought to that little
thing.</p>

<p>But Illann called the troops together and
fared forth, and made so deadly an onslaught
that he slew three hundred of Concobar’s men.
Then he quenched the fires, and went back to
the fort and to where Ailne and Ardan were
playing together.</p>

<p>“Is that rain that is making a noise without?”
said Ailne to Nathos.</p>

<p>“No; it is a humming of gnats,” answered
Nathos. “Let us play on.”</p>

<p>“My fate is heavy upon me, Nathos and
Ailne,” said Illann the Fair. “I have done
well by thee, but I feel the heavy hand of
fate is against me, and who can withstand
fate?”</p>

<p>“No one,” Nathos answered later, when he
had thought upon his play. At that Illann the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Fair drank a drink,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and went out again. The
fires had been quenched, and there was a deep
darkness. So he bade each man take a torch,
and then all set furiously again upon the Ultonians.</p>

<p>It was then that Concobar bethought him of
his son Fiacha the Fair, who was born on the
same night as Illann the Fair. There was life
to the life, or death to the death, in that.</p>

<p>So he called Fiacha, and bade him strive
with Illann, and gave him the three famous
weapons of the royalty of Uladh&mdash;the moaning
Orchaoin, and the terrible Corrthach, and the
Notched-Bow.</p>

<p>But for all his enchanted weapons Fiacha
did not prevail, and after a great and wonderful
fight, which was girt about by a strange sighing,
the sighing being the breath of the pulses of the
watching host, Illann drove him to the ground
where he crouched behind the shelter of his
shield. Easily then he might have slain him
but for this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The moaning Orchaoin made so great and
terrible a voice that it was heard afar off.
The Three Ceaseless Waves of Erin heard it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and roared responsive, so that all the coasts
shook with their thunder: the Wave of Toth
(<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tuaithe</i>), the Wave of Clidna (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cliodhna</i>), and
the Wave of Rudhraya (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Rudhraighe</i>). There
was a great dun on these coasts, named Dun
Tobairce, and there Conall Cernach the son of
Amergin lived: and when he heard the roaring
of the Three Waves of Erin, he knew that
Concobar was in dire distress.</p>

<p>And that moaning of Orchaoin brought
Conall Cernach on his magic steed that could
fly through the night. He had with him his
great sword “Blue Blade,” and when he came
to the place of the strife he moved swiftly up
behind Illann the Fair, and plunged “Blue
Blade” into the back, and through the heart,
and out at the breast of the hero.</p>

<p>But when Conall Cernach heard from Illann’s
own lips what he had done, he was filled with
wrath and grief.</p>

<p>“Thy faithless summons shall avail nought,”
he cried into the torchlit darkness where Concobar
was; and with that he took his sword,
and severed from its body the head of Fiacha
the son of Concobar, and tossed it towards the
king. Then, turning his back upon the host,
he departed as he had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>With the death of Illann the Fair, the Ultonians
once more took heart. They surrounded
the Red Branch fort, and again set red flames
leaping against it.</p>

<p>Then Ardan came forth: laughing lightly,
and with a proud joy.</p>

<p>The Ultonians saw then what it was to
perish as mown grass. And when he had slain
five times fifty, his arms grew weary.</p>

<p>“How many did Illann the Fair slay in that
onslaught of his?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Thrice five score,” he was told.</p>

<p>So Ardan slew two score and ten more, and
then another score, for it did not befit so great
a hero to slay less than an Ultonian champion,
noble as Illann the Fair was.</p>

<p>When he was tired, he went into the fort,
and told Ailne that there was still fresh carrion
enough for a wild-hawk to glut its thirst with.</p>

<p>So Ailne rose from the chessboard and
drank a drink, and went out, and did among
the Ultonians even as Ardan had done, although
he slew a score more, for he was older
than Ardan, and so it did not befit him to put
the stiffness and the silence upon fewer men.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the night were now gone, yet
Concobar did not withstay his wrath. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
now the whole host of the Ultonians was
gathered together, and he thought to have
victory at the last.</p>

<p>But at their great shouting and the higher
leaping of the flames Nathos rose. He kissed
Darthool, then he drank a drink, and went out
against the Ultonians.</p>

<p>In that hour thrice three hundred men grew
cold and stiff.</p>

<p>Then he slew five score more.</p>

<p>“Go to Concobar,” he said to a man, “and
tell him that he has lost a thousand men over
and above the hundreds slain by Illann the
Fair and Ailne and Ardan. And now let him
come to me himself.”</p>

<p>But when Concobar heard that, he sent a
messenger to Lavarcam to ask if Cathba the
Druid were yet dead; and when he heard that
he was not, he bade that the old man should
be brought to him on a litter.</p>

<p>When Cathba was brought, he asked if the
king meant death to the sons.</p>

<p>“I swear I mean no death,” said Concobar;
“but only honourably to subdue them and to
obtain Darthool. And so I pray of thee to
put an enchantment upon them, otherwise they
will slay every Ultonian in the land.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>So Cathba raised himself, and put an enchantment
between the sons of Usna and the
host of the Ultonians. That enchantment
was a hedge of spears, taller than the tallest
spear-reach, and more thickset than thorns on
a bramble-bush.</p>

<p>But Nathos and Ailne and Ardan put their
shields about Darthool, and came forth from
the blazing house, and cleft a way through
the hedge of spears, and, laughing loud, garnered
a red harvest among the swaying corn
of the Ultonian host.</p>

<p>Then there was a strange roaring heard, and
a vast and terrible flood came pouring from the
hills. The Ultonians fled to the high ground,
but Darthool and the sons of Usna were cut
off by the rushing waters.</p>

<p>Soon the flood rose to their waists, but then
it ceased rising.</p>

<p>“The wind will soon blow,” whispered Darthool,
“and then the flood will rise, and we
shall be drowned.”</p>

<p>Nathos answered nothing, but raised her in
his arms, and kissed her thrice upon the lips.
Then he put her upon his left shoulder,
where she sat with her white arms round his
neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>There was a smile in the blue eyes of
Nathos.</p>

<p>The flood now subsided, but the sons of
Usna could not move, for their feet were in
a morass. On a dry spit of land close to
them a man walked. This man was Maine of
the Red Hand, a man of Lochlin,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> in the train
of Concobar.</p>

<p>Concobar had bidden some hero go forth
and slay the sons of Usna. But none would
stir. A deep shame burned in all. But
Maine’s father and two brothers had been slain
by Nathos, and he said he would do likewise
unto the sons of Usna.</p>

<p>When he drew near, Ardan spoke.</p>

<p>“Slay me first,” he said, “for I am the
youngest of the sons of Usna: and it may be
that with my death the tides of fortune may
flow again.”</p>

<p>“That cannot be,” said Nathos. “Here is
the sword which Manannan, the son of Lir,
gave me, and that cannot leave any remains
of blow or stroke. Let this man Maine take
it, and strike at us at one and the same time,
so that not one of us may have the shame and
sorrow of seeing the other beheaded.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>And so it was. But while the man reached
for the sword, Darthool sprang from the
shoulder of Nathos, and strove to kill Maine of
the Red Hand. With a blow he reeled her
aside, and then whirled the great sword of
Manannan on high.</p>

<p>There was a flash in the air, and then the
heads of the three fairest and noblest heroes
of Alba fell. There was a long and terrible
silence, till suddenly the whole host of Uladh
broke into lamentation. Only Concobar stood
leaning on his sword, and stared at the stillness
that was now fallen upon the House of
Usna.</p>

<p>But already afar off Darthool had descried
the champion Cuchulain, and she fled towards
him.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt be safe with me, beautiful one,”
he said. “Tell me what thou wantest me to
do.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to live, but I wish to live yet
a brief hour, and not to be taken in shameful
life before the eyes of Concobar.” So
the twain returned to where the dead lay.
Darthool fell upon her knees, and spread out
the glory of her hair, and put her lips to the
blood-wet lips of Nathos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>Then she rose, and looking upon the silent
Ultonians, chanted this chant:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Is it honour that ye love, brave and chivalrous Ultonians?</div>
   <div class="verse">Or is the word of a base king better than noble truth?</div>
   <div class="verse">Of a surety ye must be glad, who have basely slain honour</div>
   <div class="verse">In slaying the three noblest and best of your brotherhood.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Ardan the Proud, where now lies his yellow hair?</div>
   <div class="verse">Ailne the Comely, where now stare his sightless eyes?</div>
   <div class="verse">Nathos, the king of men, where now is his might, his glory?</div>
   <div class="verse">Where are the sons of Usna whom ye swore to honour?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Let now my beauty that set all this warring aflame,</div>
   <div class="verse">Let now my beauty be quenched as a torch that is spent&mdash;</div>
   <div class="verse">For here shall I quench it, here, where my loved one lies,</div>
   <div class="verse">A torch shall it be for him still through the darkness of death.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And with that Darthool stooped, and lifted
the head of Nathos, and cleaned it of blood
and foam, and the sweats of death, and kissed
the eyes and the lips, and put her love upon
the dear face, and her sorrow upon it, and her
grief upon it, and put it to her white breast,
and to her lips again, and gave it again her
grief and her love.</p>

<p>Then at the bidding of Cuchulain three
graves were digged. In each grave a son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Usna was placed, and as each stood there his
head was placed upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>But the grave of Nathos was made wider.
Darthool stood therein and held his hands in
hers, and put her lips often to his lips, and
often whispered to him.</p>

<p>One other death there was in that hour, and
in that place.</p>

<p>Cathba the Druid died there: and again he
cried: “The Red Branch perisheth! Uladh
passeth! Uladh passeth!”</p>

<p>And so it was. On the morrow Emain
Macha fell before a great host, and was thenceforth
a place of ruin and wind-eddied dust.
The Red Branch became as scattered leaves,
and were no more. And Uladh was given
over to blood and rapine, and Concobar died
in a madness of grief, and throughout Erin
for many years the tides of death rose and
fell.</p>

<p>But the sons of Usna slept, and the world
dreams still of the beauty of Darthool.</p>

<p class="secthead">I</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my renderings of the three famous ancient Gaelic
tales, collectively known as “The Three Sorrows of
Story-Telling” (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tri Thruaighe na Scéalaigheachta</i>),
I have followed Professor Eugene O’Curry (<cite>In Atlantis</cite>,
<cite>Manners and Customs</cite>, and <cite>MS. Materials</cite>); Dr.
Douglas Hyde (<cite>The Three Sorrows of Story-Telling</cite>,
translated into English verse); Dr. Joyce (<cite>Old Celtic
Romances</cite>); Dr. Cameron (<cite>Reliquiæ Celticæ</cite>); Alexander
Carmichael (<cite>Trs. Gael. Socy. of Inverness</cite>); Dr.
Angus Smith (<cite>Loch Etive and the Sons of Uisnach</cite>).</p>

<p>These tales have often been retold in prose and
verse; and particular intention should be made of
the metrical versions of Dr. Douglas Hyde, Dr.
Robert Joyce (<cite>Deirdre</cite>), and, I believe, of Dr. John
Todhunter.</p>

<p>In “The Children of Lir” I have closely followed
the version of the original, as translated by Dr. P. W.
Joyce (<cite>Old Celtic Romances</cite>), and in “The Sons of
Usna” the literal prose rendering by Dr. Cameron
and the metrical translation of Dr. Douglas Hyde.
These two stories are told more completely than that
of “The Sons of Turenn,” which in the original extends
to great length, as there the narrative of the
world-wide quest of the Sons of Turenn is given with
great detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally in these retold ancient tales I have often
followed the Scoto-Gaelic variants, both because of
familiarity and by preference, and this particularly in
the tale of “Darthool and the Sons of Usna.”</p>

<p>Much the most ancient of the “Three Sorrows” is
the tale of the Sons of Turenn. Professor O’Curry’s
version in <cite>Atlantis</cite> is the basis of all other modern
renderings. The period of this tale belongs to
mythological times. “The Children of Lir” may be
taken as a connecting link between the mythological
and prehistoric and Christian periods. The tale of
“Deirdre,” or “Darthool,” is by far the best known
in Gaelic Scotland, and is still the favourite ancient
tale throughout all Gaeldom.</p>

<p>The reader who wishes further information should
consult in particular Professor Eugene O’Curry; Dr.
Cameron, in <cite>Reliquiæ Celticæ</cite>; Dr. Joyce, in <cite>Old
Celtic Romances</cite>; and Dr. Douglas Hyde, in his
delightful and deservedly popular little volume.</p>

<p class="secthead">II</p>

<p>The quatrains and other metrical pieces interpolated
here, and those in the text of the first and third
of these tales, are generally free renderings of the
originals. Occasionally they are almost literal. But,
both in the matter of selection and rejection, I have
taken certain slight advisable liberties with the original
versions. It may be as well to add, although already
explained in the footnote at page 122, that the “Song
to Macha” is here adapted from another poem known
as “Crede’s Lament” (<cite>vide Silva Godelica</cite>, Professor
Sullivan’s translation, etc.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p class="secthead">III</p>

<p>“Darthool and the Sons of Usna.” Readers familiar
only with the Irish versions of this beautiful old tale
should also consult the important variants given by
Dr. Cameron and Mr. Alexander Carmichael. Dr.
Angus Smith also gives a good digest, and readers
interested in the Scottish wayfarings of Darthool and
Nathos will find the details given there more or less
specifically.</p>

<p class="secthead">IV</p>

<p>In the story of “The Sons of Turenn” it is possible
that some injustice has been done to the character of
Lugh, the foremost personage in it, best known in all
the Gaelic chronicles as Lu-Lamfada&mdash;Lugh of the
Long Hand. In this version he is represented uniformly
as sternly cruel; but it must be borne in mind
that his inveterate hostility to the Sons of Turenn
was not due to insatiable revenge alone, but to his
belief (as prophesied by his father) that any clemency
in the fulfilment of the great eric demanded would
result in terrible disaster to Erin itself. Throughout
this ancient tale, indeed, we recognise Lu-Lamfada
as an impersonation of Destiny or Nemesis. It may
at the same time be added that in the story of “Darthool”
Fergus is shown more obviously culpable than
the old chronicles indicate, where he appears rather
as a too innocent and trustful tool of King Concobar.</p>

<p class="secthead">V</p>

<p>A few notes as to the less familiar of the Gaelic
names introduced in the foregoing pages may aptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
be given here, and the more conveniently in alphabetical
order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aé.</span> Pronounced as rhyming to day: equivalent
to Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ailne.</span> The older forms are <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ailna</i> and <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ainlé</i>.
The latter (pronounced Anlă) is probably the right
name. It is said to signify beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alba.</span> The Gaelic for Scotland. The genitive of
this word is Alban, whence the familiar English word
for Scotland, Albyn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banba.</span> This was one of the three ancient names
of Ireland&mdash;Banba, Fola, and Eiré&mdash;the names of
three famous queens of antiquity. It is from the last
that Ireland derives its best known Gaelic name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bove Derg</span> (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bodbh Dearg</i>). This semi-mythical
king was one of the old Dedannan race, and stands,
as it were, midway between the elder gods and the
historic heroes. His name in Ireland is commonly
pronounced Bove-d’Yarrag; and in Scotland as Bove
Derg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conor</span> (<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Connachar</i>). The oldest form of this
famous Gaelic name, so common in Ireland, is Concubair,
or Concobar. Dr. Hyde says that Concubair
is properly pronounced Cunnhoor, but doubtless
Concobar is closer to the ancient usage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuchulain.</span> The oldest form of the name of this
great Gaelic hero is Cuchulaind. The name is pronounced
Coo-hoolin, whether spelled according to
any of the Irish-Gaelic variants or as to the Scottish
Cuthullin&mdash;but sometimes, as in Skye, Coolin. It is
not the real name of the hero in question. The word
signifies the hound of Culainn, and innumerable references
to Cuchulain are found throughout early Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
literature simply as The Hound. He was a native
prince of Ulster, and lord of the district of Muirthemne,
lying between and including the present
towns of Dundalk and Drogheda, now called the
County of Louth, where his chief residence was
named Dun Delga (Dundalk). This celebrated hero,
the champion of the knights of the great order of
Gaelic chivalry, known as the Red Branch, was the
son of Soalte, or Sualtam, and of Decteré, sister of
the celebrated Irish king, Concobar mac Nessa (a
contemporary of Christ). His name was Setanta,
but he was commonly known as Cu-Culainn, the
Hound of Culaan, who was his instructor and war-smith
to King Concobar. The most famous of the
Knights of the Red Branch at this time were the
heroes known as Fergus mac Róigh, Conall Cearnach,
Fergus mac Leité, Curoi mac Dairé, and Cuchulain
mac Soalte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dagda</span>, or <span class="smcap">The Dagda</span>. This is a purely mythical
personage, and is one of the ancient Gaelic divinities,
among whom he occupies a place somewhat akin to
that of Jupiter in the Latin Pantheon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dedannan.</span> Pronounced Day-Donnan. This is
the colloquial form of the Tuatha-De-Danann; that
is, the elder semi-divine inhabitants of Ireland, mostly
mythical, and in some cases euhemerised. They
became the Hidden People, or People of the Hills,
of ancient Gaelic legend, and later the Fairies of
popular tradition, though now the drift of poetic
thought is towards a restoration of the Tuatha-De-Danann
to their old spiritual significance and empery.
The term signifies the Divine Progeny of Ana, a
mysterious and perhaps supreme ancient goddess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
The Dedannans were also called The Deena-Shee
(Daoine-Sidhe), or Fairy Folk; the Aes-She, or
People of the Hills; the Marcra-Shee, or Fairy
Cavalcade; and the Sloo-She (Sluagh-Sidhe), or
Fairy Host.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dun.</span> This word is properly pronounced Doon,
though in Gaelic Scotland generally Dun. It signifies
a fortress or great fortified dwelling or encampment,
and should not be confused with Rath, which
is more what we would call the homestead, hamlet,
village, or township, according to circumstances; or,
with Lis, or Lios, a smaller fort probably corresponding
to what we call a keep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eilidh.</span> The name Eilidh is pronounced Eily
(<i>Isle-ih</i>), and is said to be the Gaelic equivalent of
Helen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emania.</span> This is simply the Latinized form of
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Emhain</i>, or <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Emain</i>, the capital of North Ireland in
the ancient days. The name is variously pronounced
as Emain, Avvin, and Yew-an or Yow-an.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eric.</span> Originally eiric, pronounced ay-ric. Signifies
literally a fine or blood-money, and is perhaps
best rendered in English by the word ransom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felim.</span> This name is more familiar as Phelim.
The modern Gaelic is Phelimy, and the older, Pedlimid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geasa.</span> Pronounced Gassa. It is the plural of
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geis</i> (often written <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geas</i>), and signifies oath-bound
injunctions or undertakings. In the old days for a
man to be under <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">geasa</i> meant that he was solemnly
bound to do such and such a thing, or, as it might be,
to refrain; and the bond once taken could not be
broken without loss of honour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ildanna.</span> The old Irish word is best represented
by Il-danach, that is, the Master of Craft, or Master
of the Many Arts, and is a name which is specifically
given to Lugh Lamfada, Lugh the Long-Handed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Illann.</span> This frequent name of Illann, or Illan, is
identical with Ullin, so familiar in Scotland through
the famous poem of “Lord Ullin’s Daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lir.</span> Pronounced sometimes Lirr, but generally
Lear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lochlann.</span> A general name for the whole of
Scandinavia, including, of course, Denmark, and not,
as sometimes stated, of Norway only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lugh.</span> This name is pronounced Lu, or Loo, and
I have so given it in the text.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manannan.</span> Pronounced Mon-on-awn. He is
the Neptune of Gaelic mythology, but holds a more
mysterious and more potent position in the Gaelic
Pantheon than his classical congener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maev.</span> The name of this most famous queen of
antiquity is variously spelt. The original is Meadb,
or Medbh, and is properly pronounced Mave (rhyming
with wave).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murhemne.</span> The original of this is Magh Muirteimne,
pronounced Moy-mwir-hev-na. It is the
plain from the Boyne to near Carlingford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moyle.</span> This is the commonest pronunciation of
the old Gaelic Maol, though the word is best known
in Scotland as Mull (from the Mull of Cantyre). It
is applied to the sea between Cantyre and Ulster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mekween.</span> The original of this difficult name is
Miodcaoin. I do not know what it means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathos.</span> Originally Naisi; later Naoise; and
commonly pronounced Neeshă.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nuadh.</span> Pronounced Noo-ă.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ogam</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ogham</span>. The ancient Cryptic method
of writing, like the Northern Runes, chiefly graven on
funeral stones or monuments. The word is sometimes
pronounced <i>Oo-am</i>, or <i>oom</i>, but Ogam is probably
right according to ancient usage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shee Finnaha.</span> The old Gaelic is Fhionncaid,
and is properly pronounced Sheeh-Innăchee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tailkenn</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tailcinn</span>. This name for St.
Patrick signifies Adze-Head (probably from his
monkish tonsure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turenn.</span> The old form is Tuireann, and is pronounced
Tirran or Toorenn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulad</span>, or <span class="smcap">Uladh</span>. The old name of Ulster, of
which Ultonia is the Latinized form. Ulad is properly
pronounced Ulla.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ur.</span> This name is pronounced <i>oo-ar</i> (Gaelic, Uar).
The name in its old form is Iuchar, as that of his
brother is Iucharba, which I have given as Urba. It
is probable, however, that Ur is the modern equivalent
of Iucharba, and Yukar, or Yooch-ar (which I have
given as Urba), of the third of the Sons of Turenn.
There is great confusion and diversity in these old
names.</p>

<p>There are a number of blank pages in the original text of this book.
To conserve space, especially for handheld devices, blank pages have
been left out of this ebook.</p>

<p>This book contains Scoto-Gaelic variants. To retain the intended
flavor of the book, spelling and punctuation in dialect text have
not been altered.</p>

<p>Spelling of non-dialect wording in the text was made consistent when a
predominant preference was found in this book; if no predominant
preference was found, or if there is only one occurrence of the word,
spelling was not changed, unless noted below.</p>

<p>Single, oddly spelled words that could not be confirmed as typographical
errors were left unchanged. On page 159, “slao” was
considered to be a typographical error and changed to “slay”, which
fits the context.</p>

<p>Original punctuation has been retained.</p>

<p>Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved with
the following exception: Page <a href="#chessboard" id="chess_board">247</a> &mdash; chess-board was changed to
chessboard. All seven other occurrences of the word chessboard that
were not end-of-line hyphens did not have a hyphen.</p>

<p>The name “Ae” is used twice and “Aé” used once within the text. The
name “Taillken” was used once in the text and “Taillkenn” used twice.
No change was made in either because it could not be confirmed that they
were typographical errors.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
